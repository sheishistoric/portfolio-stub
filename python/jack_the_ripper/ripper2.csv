which we findrather a big pill to swallow - that a police official told a representative ofthe press quite coolly that the police would never detect such crimes as thewhitechapel murders, and that the only thing to do was to let the man-monstergo on murdering people till his homicidal mania wore off or wore him out. thesame authority, in the most serious manner possible, expresses its regret thatthis individual only too faithfully reflects the spirit of fatalism andpessimism that is demoralising the detective department. surely it may besafely assumed that the police authorities are doing their utmost to find theauthor of the ghastly murders, and it is a pity that they should be hamperedby the vapid nonsense indulged in by writers who seem ever ready to turn theirpen in whichever direction the tide turns. they would have been the first,doubtless, had the murderer been caught, to load the captors with fulsomeflattery.the whitechapel tragedy.the inquest on the body of annie chapman, 47, the victim of the latest whitechapeltragedy, was resumed to-day at the working lads institute, whitechapel, before mr.wynne baxter, the district coroner. - inspector chandler described the position inwhich he found chapmans body when called in on saturday morning, confirming thestatements of previous witnesses as to the state of the clothing, and adding thata portion of the intestines still connected with the body was lying over the leftshoulder, while some loose pieces of skin were lying near the head. after theremoval of the body he found lying near where the feet had been a piece of muslin,a tooth-comb, and a pocket-comb while near by was part of an envelope containingpills. on the flap of the envelope were embossed with the words ""sussex regiment""and on the front were written the letters ""m"" and ""sp,"" the rest of the words being""london, august, 1888."" a wet leather apron was also lying near by. - inspt. chandlerproceeding, said there were no indications of a struggle, and none of the palingswere broken, though they bore blood stains, as did the ground in the immediatevicinity of the body, none, however, being traceable outside the yard. most of theclothes were more or less soiled with blood. richardson informed the police earlyon saturday that a body was not there at five oclock, but anyone who only went tothe top of the steps might have failed to see it. the foreman of the jury askedwhether any steps had been taken to produce ted stanley who was said to have beenmuch in the deceaseds company, as he was a pensioner, and the envelope which wasfound bore a regimental name. it was specially desirable that he should be forthcoming.witness replied that the police had not been able to find stanley, and the coronerobserved that if he was well advised he would come forward. adverting to a furtherremark from the jury as to the desirability of offering a reward, the coroner saidhe believed the government had given up making such offers. - doctor phillips,divisional police surgeon, corroborated chandlers evidence as to the position inwhich the body lay when he was called in. he added that the face and tongue weremuch swollen, and that a portion of the small intestines and of the abdomen waslying on the ground over the right shoulder, but still attached to the body. twoother parts of the wall of the stomach were lying in a pool of blood above the leftshoulder. there were other mutilations, evidently inflicted after death, which wereof such a nature that he preferred, if possible, not to discuss them. for cuttingthe throat and for mutilating the body, a sharp, thin, narrow blade six or eightinches long must have been used, and the manner of its employment indicatedanatomical knowledge, which was perhaps not more fully displayed in consequenceof haste. no fresh facts of importance have transpired today in connection with the whitechapelmurder, beyond the evidence given at the inquest to-day. mr. phillips positiveopinion that the woman had been dead quite two hours when he first saw the body athalf-past six throws serious doubt upon the accuracy on at least two importantwitnesses, and considerably adds to the prevailing confusion. there have been nofurther arrests, but some important information respecting the two lunatics undersurveillance has been obtained."

that is the question of real importance at this moment. i cannot join in the violent abuse of the police, for i think it is unreasonable and unjust, but at the same time it must be admitted that the machinery under the control of sir chas. warren has proved unequal to the work cast upon it. the responsibility lies with the home secretary under these circumstances to devise and put in operation new machinery and to try fresh methods to meet the crisis. however, i have no hesitation in saying that i think mr. matthews has not proved himself equal to the occasion. his refusal to offer a reward in accordance with the demand of the public of all classes, has met with severe disapproval, and been very adversely contrasted with that of the lord mayor. why should not a reward be offered of such amount as would stimulate the whole population of whitechapel to search for the murderer and turn them, especially the women, into amateur detectives? if the government would offer a reward of say £10,000, i have a strong conviction it would have a magical effect in setting hundreds of people to discover clues to bring the truth to light. if mr. matthews continues obstinate  and i have reason to know that he is very obstinate  i hope in such a case the authority of the cabinet will interpose.the  east  end  murders.reported  capture  of  jack  the  ripper.telegraphing this afternoon the central news says:- the american who was arrested last night on suspicion of being concerned in the whitechapel murder was released at ten oclock this morning, inquiries having shown that his account of himself was entirely satisfactory. at the present moment there is no one in custody. the rumour of the actual murderer being caught has created intense excitement in london, but it is entirely unfounded.dr. langham this morning opened an inquiry into the death of catherine eddowes, who was found with her throat cut and her body fearfully mutilated in mitre-square.important  surgical  evidence.dr. gordon brown, surgeon of the city of london police force, gave evidence as to the state in which the body was found. there was a wound in the abdomen from which a portion of the intestines had been drawn out and placed over the right shoulder. a piece of intestine about two feet long had been detached and placed between the left arm and the body. the throat was cut, the face disfigured, and the lobe of the right ear cut obliquely. when the body was undressed at the mortuary the several portions of the ear fell from the clothing. a post-mortem examination was made on sunday afternoon. in addition to a number of slashes across the face, the throat was cut, the wound extending from the left ear to about three inches below the lobe of the right ear. the larynx was severed, and all the deep structures severed to the bone, the knife touching the cartilage of the vertebral column. the cause of death was haemorrhage from the carotid artery. death was immediate and the other mutilations were inflicted after death. the front walls of the abdomen had been laid open, and the intestines detached to a large extent. the left kidney had been carefully taken out. from the nature of the cuts it was evident that the kidney was taken by someone who knew its position and how to take it out. the part said to have been removed in a previous case had in this been cut horizontally through, leaving a stump of three-quarters of an inch, and the rest of the part had been taken away. by mr. crawford: the wounds were inflicted by a sharp pointed knife at least six inches long. the person who inflicted the wounds possessed a good deal of knowledge of the position of the organs in the abdominal cavity and the way of removing the parts. the parts removed would be of no use for surgical purposes. such a knowledge would be likely to be possessed by one used to cutting up animals. the wounds might be inflicted in five minutes. as a professional man he could assign no reason for these parts being taken away. he thought the act was that of one person only. he would not expect to find much blood on the person inflicting the wounds.  the inquiry at this point was adjourned until thursday next at half-past ten.all persons arrested today on suspicion of being concerned in the whitechapel murders have been released on giving satisfactory explanations, and none is now in custody. in connection with the recent crimes the surgical evidence given to-day has caused a profound sensation. it had been supposed that the murderer did not have time to do more than take his victims life, then roughly mutilate her body. it now appears he completed his horrible work with reckless deliberation and removed certain organs. the additional mutilation of the face is believed to be due to fears on the murderers part that he may have been seen in the womans company by someone, and therefore determined to make her identification as difficult as possible. the announcement of dr. brown of the disappearance of the uterus revived for a time the theory put forward by mr. wynne baxter, the coroner in the hanbury-street case. the british medical journal, however, states that the foreign physician who sought to purchase specimens was a gentleman of the highest respectability, that he did not offer a large price, and that he left london 18 months ago."

at the time of writing, and thereis a strong impression that the police will not lay their hands upon himunless the monster is caught in flagrante delicto. the man has committed histerrible crimes with almost fiendish skill, and in no single instance has theleast trace of the murderer been left on the scene. so far as is publiclyknown the police have no definite idea of the kind of man they want. thiscold-blooded butcher of defenceless human beings may be old or young,english or foreign, respectable or depraved in appearance, sane or insane -no one has seen him, and nobody knows. there may be a cruel frankenstein ora brutal edward hyde wandering night by night in search of victims in theparlieus of whitechapel - who can tell? is it surprising, then, that thepolice, so far, have failed to track down the murderer? it seems to us thatthe blame which has been placed on the authorities, from the home secretarydownwards, has not been deserved. the murders have been made the vehicle forbitter and unscrupulous attacks on public servants, checking their energy anddamaging their efficiency. this is one of the most regrettable facts inconnection with the public calamity. the outrages were limited to oneparticular quarter, and to a class of women whose habits render it extremelydifficult for the police to afford them ordinary protection. the persons anddwellings of decent citizens have been as safe as at any other time. thepolice of the metropolis have been increased in numbers and efficiency duringthe last two years, and london, as regards ordinary crime, compares mostfavourably with any foreign capital. yet, because a single murderer, actingwith peculiar cunning, and with extraordinary advantages, has not been instantlycaptured, an outcry has been raised for the dismissal of the home secretary, theresignation of sir charles warren, and a change in the whole system of policemanagement. so recently as tuesday night last, an envenomed attack was made uponsir charles warren by mr. asquith, m.p., at sheffield. the followers of mr.gladstone in the press have not hesitated to denounce the failure to secure thecriminal as the natural result of the ineptitude of a tory government, and thereader is left in doubt as to whether they or the unknown murderer deserve thegreatest punishment. all this is, perhaps, the outcome of the new method ofpolitics which has been introduced by mr. gladstone at the bidding of hisparnellite allies. to hamper and attack the constabulary in ireland in thedischarge of their duties has become one of the recognised weapons of thegladstonian armoury. it had a certain amount of success for a time, but haslatterly become somewhat rusty and ineffective. if we are now to have it broughtinto use in england, whenever a social calamity like the whitechapel murdersoccur, political warfare will, indeed, have reached its lowest level.a somewhat uneasy feeling, nearly allied to fear, has taken possession of manyweak-minded people in connection with the recent atrocities in the metropolis.the idle rumour that the notorious ""jack the ripper"" would shortly visitmanchester and continue his ghastly work is exercising a baneful influenceamong females and young persons which ought to be dispelled. the name of thenow notorious personage mingles in the daily talk of children, and, in thecountry districts especially, the presence of a strange tramp, let him beever so harmless, is a matter for the gravest suspicion, if not alarm. thecirculation of sensational matter like that of the lives of burke and hare,charles peace, and other scoundrels of the same stamp is responsible for agood deal of the feeling which has taken possession of these people. thenotorious ""jack"" has had a long lease in the busy metropolis, but anymaniacal acts committed outside london would hasten the end of his atrociouscareer.there has been no fresh murder in whitechapel for twelve days and perhaps nostronger evidence could be given of the depth and intensity of the feeling ofalarm that prevails than the fact that there was a feeling of positive reliefat finding that the sunday papers did not contain a report of one or moreassassinations. a re-appearance of the murderer was almost expected. twice hashe chosen the end of the first week of the month for his operations, and it isnot unreasonable to think that his omission to do so on saturday night was dueto the precautions which the police and the inhabitants are taking together.they left no dark corner unwatched and the number of police on patrol wasgreatly increased. the fact is, the whole population of whitechapel are turnedinto detectives, and it is difficult to conceive how, under such circumstances,the assassin can be harboured amongst a people whose every movement, in thestreet and in their houses, is subject to the closest scrutiny.i cannot help the apprehension that now when he finds the preparations for hiscapture in whitechapel so complete, and the attention of the authorities soconcentrated upon it, he will turn his attention to other less guarded localities,and there recommence his horrid work. there seems no reason why he should not turnto other quarters for the truth is that in many other parts of london thefacilities for such crime are as great as they are in whitechapel. meanwhile, ianticipate that sir charles warren will seize the opportunity of demanding morepolice. it is well known that the chief commissioner has long felt the necessityof increasing the police force of the metropolis, and i believe a proposal tothat effect will be made to parliament on its reassembling, and with everyprospect of success. it is to be hoped that in that case special regard will behad to the necessity for improving the detective force - for it is not to be deniedthat in that department we are lamentably weak.whitechapel murders.adjourned inquest, the verdict.the inquest on the body of catherine eddowes, the victim of the mitre-squaremurder, was resumed this morning before mr. langham, the city coroner, at themortuary in golden-lane. colonel sir james fraser and chief superintendentfoster represented the police, and mr. crawford, city solicitor, watched thecase on behalf of the city authorities. there was again a great amount ofinterest taken in the proceedings, and a considerable number of personsassembled outside the mortuary. - dr. g. w. sequeira, of dewry-street [sic],aldgate, deposed that he was the first medical man to reach the body inmitre-square on the morning of the 30th ult. he entirely agreed with theevidence given on the last occasion by dr. gordon brown, but supplementedit by stating in answer to mr. crawford, that though the body was lying inthe darkest corner of the square, the lamps would give light enough toenable the murderer to inflict the injuries. he did not regard it asprobable that the murderer had designs on any particular organ, and did notconsider that he performed the mutilations with any anatomical skill. lifecould not have been extinct for more than a quarter of an hour when he firstsaw the corpse. the person who committed the deed need not necessarily havebeen bespotted with blood. - dr. sedgwick saunders, city analyst, stated thathe made a careful examination of the deceased womans stomach, without,however, finding any trace of narcotic or other poisons. he supported theother doctors in the theory that anatomical skill was not shown by themurderer. - annie phillips, wife of a lamp black packer, living at 12,dilston-park, southwark park-road, stated that she was the daughter of thedeceased by thomas conway, to whom, her mother had always told her, she wasmarried. he and her mother used to get on badly together because the latterused to drink, whereas he was a teetotaler. it was seven or eight yearssince conway left her mother, whom she herself had not met for over twoyears. - dr. brown at this point took occasion to add to his previousevidence a refutation of the suggestion that the body had been conveyed tomitre-square after the murder. - evidence was then taken showing themovements of the murdered woman on the night of the 29th. at half-pasteight p.c. robinson saw her lying very drunk on the pavement in aldgatehigh-street, and someone in the crowd which had gathered knew her. as shewas unable to stand he took her to bishopsgate-street station. she waswearing an apron, now identified as that subsequently picked up markedwith bloodstains near the body. deceased was locked up till one oclock,when, as she had got sober, she was discharged on giving her name andaddress. these, she said, were mary ann kelly, of 6, fashion-street. onleaving the station she was seen by the gaoler to turn towards houndsditch,which would lead her in the direction of mitre-square. before going, however,she remarked on learning the time, that she would get a ""fine hiding"" whenshe got home. - joseph lewindale [sic] stated that as he and some friends wereleaving the imperial club, duke-street, about half-past one, they saw a man anda woman talking together in church passage. he did not see the womans face, butdeceaseds clothes looked like those she was wearing. the man had on a peakedcloth cap. - mr. crawford, interposing, asked that unless the jury particularlywished it, the mans appearance should not be further described. - the juryagreed, and witness only added that he doubted whether he should recognise theman again. - police-constable alfred lock [sic] proved the finding of theblood-stained apron in goulston-street just before three oclock on sundaymorning, and stated that on the wall just above the place where it wasdiscovered were written in chalk the words, ""the jews are the men,

by thejury: the pipe had not been smoked, and was what they termed in a lodginghouse a ""nose warmer."" - mrs smith, recalled, said the laundry closed at eightoclock, and the baths at ten oclock, but it was usually 11 oclock beforeall the men were gone. - dr george baxter phillips, divisional surgeon ofpolice to the h division, spoke to being summoned at one oclock to castlealley and seeing the body under the gas lamp. - yesterday he made a post mortemexamination. rigor mortis was well marked, especially in the limbs, the body wasstill warm. on one of the legs was a well defined bruise about the size of ashilling, and on the right side, an inch below the junction of the collar bone,with the breast bone was a large well defined bruise. seven inches below theright nipple, in a line continuous with it, commenced an external wound seveninches long, and deepest at its middle part. it only divided the skin andsubcutaneous tissues, but did not divide any muscular structure, and did notcommunicate with the internal cavity of the abdomen. there were seven scoredwounds, and from the middle of the larger wound were nine other scored wounds,reaching only through the skin. - the wound in the neck was four inches long,reaching from the top of the neck into the muscles, which were almost entirelydivided. it reached from the fore part of the neck to a point four inches belowthe chin. it must have taken a somewhat upward direction, and judging by varioussmaller wounds, the first incision seemed to have been interrupted by theprominence of the lower jaw. there was a second incision, which he took it wascommenced from behind, immediately below the first described incision. the secondincision joined the first incision in its deepest part, which was immediately overthe carotid vessels, which were entirely severed down to the spinal column. thesecond wound was about four inches below the angle of the mouth. he had not theslightest doubt the cause of death was syncope, arising from loss of blood, andthat such death probably was almost instantaneous. there was not any division ofthe upper portion or any portion of the air passages. - the coroner, addressingthe jury, said the doctor desired to preserve certain points, and he, therefore,proposed the further examination of phillips should be postponed until after theadjournment, which was fixed for august 14th, at 10 a.m.there are no persons in custody at present in connection with the murder.is the murderer left handed?having described the nature and position of the wound on the neck, the new yorkherald (london edition) says:- this shows clearly two things - the first beingthat the man stood behind her. the second is a bit of evidence that may turn outto be very important. it is that the murderer is left-handed; no right-handedman could, by any possibility, have made the wound that appeared.the theory that most generally prevails is that the murderer is a religious crank,who imagines he has a mission to perform, and like the fanatics of mahomets time,the more atrocious the butcheries he performs the greater the saint he thinks himself.a womans story.telegraphing at nine p.m., the central news says:- the murderer still remainsundiscovered, and the police have as far as is known no clue to work upon.early this morning a woman reported at a police station in walworth, southlondon, that she was accosted last night in bishopsgate by a man who said helived in walworth, and persuaded her to accompany him there. as they passedalong an unfrequented thoroughfare he attempted to force her down on theground, and when she screamed drew a long-bladed knife and threatened torip her up. she, however, continued to call for help, and as footsteps wereheard approaching her assailant decamped. he was pursued by a passer-by, butsucceeded in escaping. the woman described the man as of dark complexion,about 5 feet 9 inches in height, and wearing black clothes. the descriptionhas been circulated throughout the metropolitan police district. the policeauthorities decline to state whether they consider the incident may affordany help in elucidating the whitechapel mystery. the peterborough policesaid that alice mackenzie, who was murdered in castle alley, was not anative of that city. six months ago she was arrested there on a charge ofvagrancy, being intoxicated when arrested. nothing was previously known ofher. she said she came from scotland.list of the east-end murders.since christmas week in 1887 eight women have been murdered in the east endunder mysterious circumstances, five of them within a period of eight weeks.the following are the dates of the crimes and names of the victims so faras known:-christmas week, 1887. -

the most reasonable theory is that the monomaniac has been injured, or thinks he has, by one of these  women, and is wreaking his vengeance on the class. his cunning is wonderful - not an uncommon thing in monomaniacs. dr.  william hammond, the eminent alienist, very sensible says the police have gone wrong from the start, because they have looked  only for a self evident villain, a man ""whose face would go far to hang him"", while the probabilities are many to one that  the perpetrator is a decorous and soft spoken gentleman, living an apparently virtuous life, a man whose closest  acquaintances do not suspect of crime. such was the appearance of the noted de retz, the french ""bluebeard"" above referred  to, and of the young man who confessed to seventeen murders. incidentally, it may be noted that kate bender was not at all  unattractive, and that jesse pomeroy was what many people would call a ""fine looking boy."" he was sent to the massachusetts  state's prison for life, and though the papers stated that kate escaped, there are men in kansas who could show you the very  spot where she, her half witted brother and her parents were laid beneath the prairie sod.chief inspector byrnes, of new york city, accepts the opinion of dr. hammond and insists that the new york police could have  caught the man by using the women as decoys. he added:""we caught the fellow who had a mania for throwing vitriol upon womens' dresses red handed immediately after it was reported.  his crime was localized. he frequented fourteenth street. i made victims for him, and my men were thickly scattered through  that district. we have no such autocratic powers as the london police, but if a crime is so plainly localized in one  particular district, as in the case of these london murders, we would most assuredly arrest the perpetrator in short order."""

local superintendents send there reports of crimes which have been committed during the previous twenty four hours every morning, and the director is supposed to issue the instructions regarding them, but practically the inspectors are independent, for the matter of any crime is usually remanded to them. the detective force of london consists of 400 men in summer and 700 in winter. they are chosen from the police for their ingenuity in tracking criminals, so far as that is apparent. the scotland yard force consists of eighty men, nearly all of whom rank as inspectors. this force has so long been the focus of observation in criminal investigation, it has been called upon so often to assist the novelist, especially one whose plot covers a crime, or one who writes detective stories, that its reputation has become worldwide from this source alone, without considering the many remarkable criminal cases with which it has had to do. novelists, however, have often taken great liberties with scotland yard rules. the force is used for london alone, a london detective being scarcely ever sent anywhere else. yet many a story teller has summoned a scotland yard detective to help him out with his plot, to go where his chief would not think of sending him. but with the novelist all things are possible; the inspector arrives, and if the ingenuity of the real detective and his luck were a tithe of what they are in the novel, no guilty man would ever escape. the force is under the direct orders of the assistant commissioner. it investigates notable crimes like the whitechapel murders, but its principal business is embezzlements, forgeries and other similar matters. it also does a great deal of government work, both for the british crown and for the governments of foreign countries. the force also is expected to investigate all applications for naturalization and attend popular gatherings, besides keeping an eye in all professional criminals who may be at large. once a week a scotland yard detective goes to the city prisons to look at the prisoners awaiting trial and see if any are known to him. the foreign correspondence is an important item. formerly this work was done by a force of civil service clerks. now it is all done at scotland yard, and each letter received is replied to in the language in which it is written. there is, doubtless, much variety and excitement in the work of a detective. he must take what clew he has, if any, and follow the dictates of his own ingenuity. often he ingratiates himself into the confidences of the suspected criminal, and detectives have been known to live with a criminal for months before getting the proof required for conviction. recently in chicago at an anarchist trial one of the prisoners, who was being pressed too hard by the questions of a lawyer, stepped aside from among the criminals and began to chat familiarly with the prosecuting attorney. he proved to be a detective who had been so familiar with the accused as to be arrested and tried for the offense they had committed.

a horrible letter.london had begun to forget all about the horrible whitechapel murders, when one morning not long ago the great metropolis was  shaken from the innermost recesses of the city to the elegant suburbs that have been lately built for the occupation of the  wealthy and cultivated by the announcement that sir charles warren's dogs were loose.sir charles had for some time been training these dogs, with a view to having them track and tree (sic) the human fiend who  has been operating in whitechapel, whenever that shrewd ghoul should kill another victim. all the world remembers how much  sir charles banked upon his bloodhounds and how he made himself a laughing stck of everybody by letting them chase his august  person one every early morning not long ago. one would imagine that his experience would have shaken his faith in the wisdom  of the scheme, for, so the account runs, they only succeeded in making even a fair showing one time in three.the fact is, almost any one conversant with the employment of hounds for tracking persons will tell you, it is quite a  different matter for a dog to take up and follow a scent across a sparsely settled country, and through the intricate mazes  of a densely populated city.it is not at all uncommon for a dog to quite lose the scent in the former instance because of one crossing track. in a  crowded metropolitan district like whitechapel, where any given track would be criss-crossed by tens of thousands of other  tracks inside of an hour, the task of following the murderer by the scent would be altogether beyond the power of even the  keenest nosed dog.and even if sir charles' experiments had been successful to a marked degree, the results would have justified no sanguine  expectations. for the experiments were made early in the morning when few people would be stirring, and the chance of  obliteration by subsequent trails would be at the minimum, whereas the search for the murderer would, very likely, have to be  made at a busy time of the day.when sir charles lost the dogs he was trying them in the open country. they had been taken to a common in the suburbs and  there ""laid on scent after scent.""whether they showed any progress in the noble art of man hunting is not stated, but when let loose on what proved to be their  last run they were ""lost sight of altogether"", and ""the men in charge were frantic."" certain carpers at sir charles' method  of running the police department have suggested that ""perhaps some smart dog fancier has made a greart haul of the prize  hounds.""it is quite possible that this last exploit of sir charles warren will move the london publications that sail under comic  colors to the printing of cartoons bearing upon the subject. punch has already devoted considerable attention to the  whitechapel matter, and here is a reduced reproduction of one of its cartoons, heading and all:the nemesis of neglect is shown heresir charles warren is a most extraordinary person, if we may believe the english newspaper stories about him. he doesn't seem  to have the slightest qualification for the position of chief of police, and the office came to him only because he was born  with patrician blood in his veins.he has been a soldier, and a fairly good one, too - serving abroad - and therein, perhaps, lies much of the secret of his ill  success. if he had been willing to act simply as a figure head, let other and more capable men attend to the executive part  - the real work of the department - matters would probably never have reached such a pass as to render the whitechapel  murders possible.but, having won some reputation as a fighter of savages, he felt that he knew just how to preserve order in a city largely  composed of civilized people. brooking no interference with his plan of conducting the affairs of the office of chief of  police on the lines of a military campaign, and fully imbued with the idea that the chief end of the police is to suppress  free speech and all sympathy with the irish, whom he hates so bitterly, he devoted his energies to closing public places to  speakers who are dissatisfied with the existing order of things in england and the following and arrest of americans and  others supposed to have a friendly feeling towards erin's green isle. of course it was not long before the scotland yard men  and the ""bobbies"" alike expended whatever abilities they possess in these directions, and what are on other countries are  considered the most hateful classes flourished unhurt and plied their criminal callings unmolested. in this connection are  presented portraits of inspector helstone and coroner baker, two officials who have ably seconded sir charles warren's policy  of marked incapability."

whitechapelthree murders before the public were interested - two more create a regular panic - the isolated case in the north of england  - two more, and the most shocking of all, within one hour - a reign of terror in whitechapel - the various theories: an american, a homicidal lunatic, a ""sexual pervert"", a lascar or a medieval ghoul?during the first week in september the people in london learned with amazement, not unmixed with horror, that there was an  unknown and mysterious murderer haunting that district commonly called whitechapel. to describe the central section of this  district in terms fit for refined readers is not possible. it combines the worst features of old ""st giles"", as london  novelists once described it; of the five points of new york as it was in 1850 and of the chinese quarters of san francisco,  and has, in addition, some local horrors of its own. what whitechapel is.it is a tangled wilderness of narrow streets and shut alleys, dark lanes and dirty courts, surrounded by vile gin shops and  viler lodging houses. it is the center of the noted east end of london, and lies on both sides of the broad whitechapel road,  which is the main outlet in that direction through stratford and ilford into the agricultural districts of essex. the  population of whitechapel may be broadly divided into three classes: the fairly well to do tradesmen, the industrious but ill  paid artisans, and the hopeless, homeless, helpless thousands of unemployed who drag out an existence from day to day as  devoid of ease and comfort as any of god's creatures on this broad earth. common lodging houses abound in whitechapel, and  wretched and miserable as are every variety of these refuges of the destitute and desolate, the east end ""padding kens"" enjoy  an unenviable notoriety as the filthiest and most disreputable of their kind.within a very small territory, which is traversed by but five streets of any width beside the whitechapel road, are crowded  at least 150,00 human beings; and there vice prevails in its most revolting forms. by day the district is comparatively  quiet; but soon after nightfall all the ""gin palaces"" are lighted up, dark red lanterns shine dimly in the narrow passages  leading to the inner courts, the occasional sound of music is heard from a low concert room a cellar ""dive"", and the streets  are thronged by reckless sailors, adventurous apprentices, curious visitors and the regular habitues of the locality. and  among the latter are hundreds of women whose only care is to procure the means for one day's food, one night's lodging, and  the fiery liquor which temporarily drowns reason and remorse. of course, many of these women are accomplices in robbery; and  there are houses in the narrower streets lying off the main thoroughfares in which every facility is afforded for hocusing  and robbing the already half drunken prey of these painted jezebels. scarcely a day passes but a tale of daring robbery is  unfolded in th adjacent police court, in which these women and their contemptible male companions figure as the despoilers of  inebriated sailors or workmen.such is whitechapel; such are its inhabitants and visitors, and such are the women from whom this modern ghoul selects his  victims. the reader will see at once why the case presents almost insuperable difficulties to the police. not only is the  environment the best for murder, but the victims naturally avoid the police, and conduct the murderer to the most secret  places.work of the fiendthe first murder was in august and attracted little attentionin august 1887 (sic) the first of these murders occurred; but it was only noticed as a curious variation of the many murders  in whitechapel. on the morning of aug. 7, this year, a policeman on his regular beat in the rear of old whitechapel church  found the body of a poorly clad woman on the pavement in front of a row of small houses standing in a blind alley. day was  just breaking when the officer found the body. she was quite dead and her throat was cut from ear to ear. a subsequent  examination of the remains disclosed the fact that she had been disemboweled after death.at the inquest the body was identified as that of one martha turner, a social outcast well known to the police of the  district as an habitual frequenter of the whitechapel road. the police, aided by scotland yard and city detectives, worked  hard on the case but failed to obtain the slightest clew to the murderer.on aug. 31, just before daybreak, a policeman found another woman of the same class, named mary ann nicholls, lying dead,  with her throat cut in precisely the same manner as martha turner's had been and with the same nameless outrages committed  upon the body after death. the body of his second victim was found in buck's court, a narrow thoroughfare running off brady  street and only 200 yards distant from the scene of the first murder. the woman nicholls was well known in the neighborhood,  but all efforts to discover a motive for her assassination or the wretch who butchered her proved completely abortive.the third murder brought the matter to the attention of newspaper readers everywhere, and scores of curious theories were  offered. the police force of the neighborhood was double, scores of detectives from other districts were dropped into the  district. citizens by the hundred patrolled the streets throughout the nights, suspicious looking men prowling around after  dark were arrested on suspicion by the score, but the murderer remained at large. exactly a week later, almost to the very  hour, a policeman discovered the dead body of annie sievey in the open doorway of a tenement house in hanbury street, a  narrow lane at the back of one of the great whitechapel breweries. again the victim was an ""unfortunate"", and again her throat  was cut from ear to ear, but in his devilish treatment of the remains the fiend had exhibited an accession of blood curdling  brutality hitherto unprecedented in the annals of barbarous and revolting crimes. he had actually torn out the woman's heart  and laid it across the face along with the viscera.the police begin work.the police redoubled their efforts; all the lodging houses of the district were polled, and every man required to give an  account of himself. many men were arrested, but proved innocent; but at length the public mind settled down to the belief that  a wild looking, half insane israelite of the vicinity was the guilty man. the police held him some time, but it was easily  proved that he spent his evenings indoors, and that he had not the physical strength which circumstances show the murderer to  possess. it is a curious fact, by the way, that the worst murders were perpetrated in a region occupied almost entirely by  foreigners, and one of them under the very windows of a club house used by socialists from eastern europe.the fourth murder completed the chain of evidence as to the general nature of the crimes. it was demonstrated that the  murderer possessed great strength; that he was able to prevent his victims from making an outcry; that he probably killed at  a single blow; that his animosity, or whatever the motive is, was directed against a single class, or that he considered them  safer victims; that robbery was not a motive, and that he was probably actuated by a monomaniacal frenzy not inconsistent  with apparent sanity in other matters, of which mental and moral perversion history unhappily gives many instances. and on  these facts local opinion attributed the murders to a mysterious person called ""leather apron"", because he wore one of those  articles and no one knew his real name. no one can remember having seen this man in daytime, and he has not arrested; but  some of the women of the quarter testify that he was often seen at night, and that he wore a shoemaker's knife under his  apron. since the search became very vigorous he has not been seen.the murder at gateshead.there was a pause of two weeks, and then a woman of the same class was found dead and similarly mutilated in gateshead. this  is part of the great northern english seaport and manufacturing town, newcastle-on-tyne. newcastle lies on one side of the  river tyne and gateshead on the other. the two towns are connected by three bridges. the iron foundries, locomotive works,  machine shops and many other important industries are located in gateshead and the contiguous districts of biker, walker and  scotswood. many thousands of men are employed in the various works, and they and their families reside for the most part in  and around gateshead. the last year or two fully one fifth of the whole working population of the district, which numbers  over 12,000, have been out of employment, and during last winter but for the establishment and maintenance of a liberal  scheme of outdoor relief hundreds must have literally perished  of hunger. the people are densely ignorant, brutal in their  habits, and live for the most part  in a condition of filthy squalor. the speech of the natives is simply unintelligible to  strangers, and their manners are as rough and harsh as their vernacular. the abandoned women from amongst whom the murderer  here, as in whitechapel, selected his victim are in gateshead sunk to the lowest depth of human abasement.absurd theories advanced.about this time two curiously absurd stories gained credence. it was said than an american medical student had offered a  large sum for several specimens of the uterus, and that he, or some vile agent of his, was murdering these women to obtain  them. for some time the alleged ""american"" was eagerly looked for; but the fact that such specimens can be obtained at small  expense dissipated that theory. another was that the murderer was a woman dressed in man's clothes; but no motive could be  conceived. another theory - that the murderer had suffered robbery or worse by association with such women, and was seeking  revenge - is still maintained by many; but medical men are almost unanimous in the opinion that the perpetrator is simply a  homicidal maniac, probably a ""sexual pervert"" - one in whom the natural instincts have been perverted by disease or excess  into a blind hatred or morbid desire for blood. and while these theories were being discussed the most shocking cases  occurred - two murders within the same midnight hour.a few minutes before midnight of sept. 29 a woman's corpse, still warm and quivering, was found on the sidewalk on berners  street, a narrow thoroughfare of the dangerous district; and an added element of amazement lies in the fact that at that hour  there are still many persons on the street, and at that very time the socialists were holding their meeting in a hall near  by. in fact, it was a foreign laborer on his way to the meeting who first discovered the corpse.most horrid work.the blood was still flowing, the corpse still warm; the murderer had been frightened away before completing the mutilation,  yet he had lustily slashed and hacked the body. the chief commissioner of police, sir charles warren, was hastily called from  his bed, and ordered all the available policemen into the district. in a short time they found another warm and bleeding  corpse in mitre square, not ten minutes walk from the scene of the other murder. it was truly a night of horrors. the  murderer, evidently enraged at being driven from his first victim, had rushed to the next convenient spot and slaughtered the  first woman he could secure.he had had time to do his fiendish work thoroughly. the victim's clothes had been thrown over her head and one horrible slash  with a large knife had laid the body open from the pelvis to the ribs. a cross cut had then divided it almost to the  backbone. the viscera had then been torn out and scattered over the corpse, and a great number of small stabs inflicted upon  the corpse. the sight was indescribably horrible. the policeman who discovered the body fainted. the next day was one long to  be remembered in whitechapel. not only were all the denizens drawn to the spot by the horrible fascination, but many  thousands from other parts of london. a correspondent of the new york sun gives the following:""london is dreadfully frightened. scores of women are hysterical. tens of thousands could not possibly be induced to stop out  alone. everyone, of course, expects fresh atrocities, and that is how things stand at present. it is not flattering to the  police nor comforting to londoners, who imagined themselves well protected. the following tells what is known of the fresh  crimes, which, as an evidence of an almost unprecedented condition of the human mind, are more interesting to the philosopher  even than to the simple citizen who likes to have his blood curdled.the depths of whitechapel.""your correspondent has spent from early evening until now, past midnight, wandering through the whitechapel slums. the best  idea of the awful degradation of the men there can be gathered from a description of the women, whose ability to keep alive  proves the existence of men so low as to consort with them. these wretched women swarm the streets by thousands even now, but  keep close together and look sharply around for murderers, even while pretending to laugh, and asking each other whose turn  to be cut up will come next. the language in which they speak of the fiend who has made it his business to murder them it is  impossible to reproduce. such profanity and hideously foul language as may be heard coming from the group of women of any  whitechapel corner can probably not be heard anywhere else. some of these poor animals have actually grown old in their  misery, shriveled, horrible, gin soaked hags, who fight and quarrel on the gutter's edge, and to approach within yards of  whom is torture.""the younger women, the queens of these slums, are even more distressing to look at. some are mere girls, almost children,  but all celebrate any stroke of fortune by getting drunk. bright colors distinguish them. light blue is the favorite color.  cheap brocades, dragging in the mud, and ostrich feathers, so sadly out of curl as the dissipated owners' hair, are favorite  outward signs of such prosperity as may be attained in whitechapel. the poor creatures when born were dropped upon the surface  of the worst pool of degradation that can be boasted by any great city on earth, and all they can do is to sink deeper down  into it, fighting and drinking cheap gin as they go.""infants crawling through heaps of refuse in the slums, never having been made jealous by the sight of clean, fat babyhood,  were fairly contented, and their parents evidently found their lives much enlivened by the sensation which had come upon  them. the scenes of both murders were swarming with curious crowds, preference being given to the place where the most savage  murder occurred, and up to tonight morbid citizens were busy lighting wax matches in the dark corner of mitre square trying  to discover blood stains.""seeking the murderer.criticism of the police - testimony and false confessions. much unjust criticism of the london police has resulted, but a glance at the testimony will convince any one that with such  witnesses and in such a locality it is almost impossible to get a clew. for instance, at the inquest on the body found in  berners street, a sister of the victim was called and deposed that she awoke and heard kisses and a sound which she thought  was made by a person falling to the ground. she was convinced that her sister was dead, and, after reading the accounts of  the murder in the newspapers, went to the morgue and recognized the body of the murdered woman as that of her sister. as she  lives some distance away, this is taken to prove that the body of the murdered woman was carried to the place where it was  found. but how could the perpetrator do that without getting blood upon his clothing; and how could a man with bloody  clothing escape all scrutiny? to such questions the police have as yet no answer, and the stupidity or drunken indifference,  at the time of the murder, of the friends of the murdered women appears to be such that very little can be learned from them.the inquest on the other body found that night was somewhat more satisfactory. it was shown that the murderer met the women  at some distance from the square and walked with her along the main street that led to the square. it was probably this fact  that caused the murderer to mutilate the face of his victim, as he feared that they had been noticed in company and the  woman's identification would lead to his capture. the faces of the other whitechapel victims were untouched, while this one's  was hacked beyond recognition. various measures were then adopted by the people of the east end for their protection, as  little confidence is felt in the police. that night fifty working men, all armed and ready to attack even a blood-thirsty  insane man, patrolled the neighborhood frequented by the murderer. the papers print columns of letters on the subject every  day and suggestions are numerous. the latest is that public prayers shall be said as a means of gaining relief from this  epidemic of murders.the next suggestion was by a sailor named dodge, who declared that in august last he met a malay cook named al aska, with whom  he had previously been acquainted on  shipboard, in a music hall in london, and that al aska told him he had been robbed of  all he had by a woman of the town, and threatened that unless he found the woman and recovered his property he would kill and  mutilate every whitechapel woman he met. the police searched the city, but no such malay was found.delusions of feeble minds.and now appeared one of the strangest phenomena connected with such crimes - one that all criminal history shows to be a  concomitant of popular excitement. people began to ""confess"" - one in person and meny by letter. john fitzgerald surrendered  himself to the police as the murderer, and apparently thought he was; but he was easily proved to be a feeble hypochondriac.  a letter signed ""jack the ripper"" was received by the police. it addresses the chief as ""dear old boss"", confesses to the  murders and says the motive is revenge. another letter of ""confession"" gives religious conviction as the reason, and alleges  that the writer has a mission to drive all lewd women from london.""fifteen more!""on the wall by one of the victims these worlds were rudely scrawled: ""this is five; fifteen more and i give myself up;"" and  various letters in the same strain have been received. during the same time there has been a great increase in robberies and  street outrages in every part of london.another horror, the seventh for london, came to light on oct. 2, when a woman's corpse, far advanced in decomposition, was  found within sight of the police headquarters in scotland yard. it had been literally hacked to pieces, and a pair of arms  found in another place some time before were probably those of this corpse. one important fact was now proved. when the  murderer wrote on the wall the he had killed five only four were known; it is evident that this last discovered woman was  killed before that time, and the police accept this as evidence that the writer was the wholesale murderer. but whether that  knowledge brings them any nearer catching him is quite another matter. for the present london holds its breath in a sort of  tremulous waiting for another murder.the situation is not without some amusing features, and surely a little of that sort of thing will be a relief after such a  feast of horrors. the sun correspondent above quoted writes:grim humor of the case.""the greatest effect produced by the series of butcheries has been upon women of a different class. probably the most  hysterical female in existence just now is the, as a rule, calm and unmoved london chambermaid. when the london fog creeps  down it finds lots of park benches in the west end on which there is neither chambermaid nor soldier. that is beyond all  question an entirely new sensation for the london fog.""a friend has assured me that peace has reigned in his household since sept. 8, when the terror commenced, because not a  solitary female servant has wanted an evening out. the effect of the murders has not done the gentleman's wife as much good  as it would have done but for the fact that she is most awfully frightened, too. another friend, less fortunate, finds himself  deprived of the services of his only male servant, as the maids and the cook must have their airing, and won't go out alone.""theories are being built up by thousands, but they are not worth much. i chanced to hear that of george lewis, the best  known solicitor in london. he believes the woman killer to be a religious maniac, who has sworn to root out the social evil,  and has adopted the plan in each case of making his punishment so awful as to deter others from evil ways. this view, i  learn, is shared by sir james risdon bennett, an eminent authority on lunacy, who has expressed the opinion that the murderer  imagines himself ordained from above to kill all bad women, and has set about his difficult task with lunatic enthusiasm.clumsiness of the police.""until something is found out london is going to be mighty nervous, and it grows evident that if the murderer is taken it  will be his fault. detectives in plain clothes, on whom london relies, are swarming in whitechapel, it is true, but as a rule  they wear regular police boots and go two by two. they may readily be distinguished a block off when it's clear. i would  again advise some american to come over and prove there is still a detective left who can detect.""the london police labor under some peculiar disadvantages. by the last returns they number 10,940, as against 8,250 in paris  and 3,264 in new york, but london contains three times as many people as new york; is spread over six times the area, and yet  the very poor and the lowest criminal classes are crowded as in new york and their districts are vastly more difficult to  police. a considerable portion of the older part of the city of london is built on the most irregular and confusing lines.  dark alleys, small courts, squares having but one street of egress, and narrow lanes make up a good part of the great city,  and it would require at least 50,000 policemen properly to cover the whole of london. the stringent police regulations, which  require the emptying of public houses at the hour of 1, while adding to the security of those parts of the british metropolis  where such houses most abound, increase also their insecurity after that hour. with, therefore, a force of men wholly  insufficient for the first duty they have in hand - the watching of the public streets - it is not strange that in such dark  corners as mitre square such daring deeds of violence are done after nightfall with impunity.an excited and indignant public must have a scapegoat, and london has, by common consent, selected for a victim sir charles  warren, chief commissioner of police. much color is given to the common accusation by the fact that there was a serious  quarrel among the police after the trafalgar square riots, and that in august last the force was generally remodeled.after being badgered by a corps of critics and men offering all sorts of suggestions, sir charles has consented to the use of  bloodhounds for tracking the murderer, but the methods proposed for their employment make it plain enough to an american that  the londoners know very little about the nature of that brute.opinions of alienists.of course all the eminent alienists have been called on for an opinion, and their concurrent statement as to what the lunatic  is capable of doing without detection is enough to frighten the london women out of their few remaining senses. they report  and cite many cases to prove that the old notions of human vampires, ghouls weir wolves and demoniacs were based on actual  facts; that in very age there have been men seized with an insane desire to slay and mutilate women, that along with this  there is often unnatural cunning in concealment and that actual cannibalism is not an unfrequent accompaniment. dr. william  a. hammond adds that what are called ""sexual perverts"" are practically unknown in america, but in countries where there is  less freedom, and where the relations of the sexes are not on such a natural basis, they are often met with. perhaps the most  recent case of note is that of sergt. bertrand of the french army, who was arrested in paris as a ghoul in 1847, and  convicted of digging up the corpses of women in the cemetery. the particulars of his cannibalism, published by the french  medical author, morel, cannot even be hinted at here.trying the bloodhoundssir charles warren lets the dogs chase him as an experimentthe london police have engaged in what looks to americans much like comedy, that is in ""testing"" the bloodhounds. the  correspondent of the new york sun gives this account of it: it was barely daybreak, and the frost lay thick upon the grass,  when warren's stalwart form showed the way to the place of trial, followed by a few experts, one holding a pair of dogs in  the leash.sir charles' enthusiasm.sir charles, in a fit of enthusiasm, offered himself for the quarry, and started off at a good swinging trot. he was soon  lost to sight, and then different policemen crossed his track. the dogs were laid on, and worked surely but slowly along  until they arrived at the sopt where the first policeman had crossed the trail. here the dogs were at fault for a time. but  soon took up the scent again, the 2 year-old burgho, who won first prize in the new york dog show this year, leading off.  burgho has been trained from a puppy to hunt the clean shoe and was well up to the work, though evidently the scent did not  lie well. finally both dogs failed, going off on some side scent.a new trial was started. sir charles again acted the hunted man, taking 1,200 yards start. the dogs did well for a while, but  finally were baffled, owing to the number of people who crossed the trail. three more courses were tried, but in only one did  the hounds succeed in catching their man, and then they licked and fondled him as an old friend.not altogether unsatisfactory.considering that the dogs were following the scent of a man alone, and that the morning was extremely bad for following any  trail, the result was not altogether unsatisfactory. if the whitechapel murderer, on the occasion of his next crime, smears  himself with blood or carries off any portion of the body, it is believed the dogs will hunt him down.sir charles warren, in his tight military dress, and puffing and blowing with his exertions, did not look a very dignified  chief commissioner, but if he went back to scotland yard hot and tired it was certainly with the most novel feeling that he  had a made a good start with his day's work. he was very mad when the evening newspapers came out with reports of his  morning's doings, which doubtless were also read and noted by the murderer.   probably a lunatic.the opinions of experts - the law of atonement.professor ordrenaux, of columbia college law school, author of standard works on the legal bearings of insanity, and for nine  years state commissioner of lunacy for new york, gives this opinion:is the london fiend insane?""the murderer is a lunatic, of course. there is no doubt of that. his very cleverness in eluding the police might be a proof  of it. the devilish cunning and resource of some maniacs is marvelous. the question is, what frightful nightmare of madness  is this that possesses him? when he is caught he will speak out; he won't hesitate to give reasons as far as he is able.""meanwhile, we can only guess. but cases of the kind have not been so rare that we need guess at random. the vampires of the  middle ages  that haunted the cemeteries and dug up the bodies of women to tear the flesh from their bones were doubtless  madmen of his caliber. they were a very real terror to their time, not at all creatures of an excited fancy. at times their  peculiar madness became fairly epidemic on the continent of europe. the reason why the psychology of the middle ages presents  many more such cases than our day is that then they ran unhindered, while nowadays such lunatics would be very soon arrested.""science may ridicule the idea of demoniacal possession. those who deny that there is anything but matter will see no proof to  the contrary. proof expires with the conditions of matter you are examining, and when you drop the subject as a mental and  take it up as a moral question you tread on uncertain ground in a sense. it is true that you cannot find a demon with a  microscope or figure it out by tables of logarithms: and yet it is not irrational to suppose that a distance evil agency does  dominate the human mind under circumstances when it is overthrown to the last degree and has lost its personal and subjective  identity. when insanity, originating in a perversion of the sexual instinct, passes beyond bounds within which it can be  explained on conditions of physical deterioration, it is permissible to recognize a superhuman cause as the controlling power  in the domination of human conduct. this is demoniacal possession. granted that the only foundation for belief in it is the  utterly inhuman and illogical conduct of the victim, yet if he alone of ten thousand lunatics similarly affected goes this  length, we shall have to assume either that he is a being differently formed, which we cannot do, or that some new agency is  discovered in his case, as in that of this london murderer. here is where 'possession of an evil spirit' steps in to supply  the explanation. it seems to me as admissible in this last emergency as the law of gravitation. nobody sees it, yet nobody  doubts it. we all see its results.blood atonement.""the law of blood atonement is written on the constitution of the human mind, and when utterly perverted by a sense of  intolerable wrong makes of the man such an ogre as this slayer of women. there are many kinds of vampirism, but they all  cluster around this one idea of motiveless mutilation of dead bodies. no one would do the deeds of this monster unless  dominated by the law of blood atonement mingled with an evil principle that then takes the form of demoniacal possession.""the law must furnish by punishment some motive for the man to resist. the taking possession of a mind is a gradual process,  a consequence of willful sin against nature's law, or weak yielding. the whole subject opens up such a wide field of  metaphysical study and religious suggestion that you cannot answer any question in one word, yes or mo. it is yes up to a  certain point and no beyond it.""dr. hammond is also emphatic in his opinion that such murderers should be executed, and alienists generally are adopting the  view that a monomaniac is often morally responsible for his condition and that the responsibility can be fixed. and, adopting  the opinion of medical men, the london police now have a theory that satisfies them and claim to have a particular individual  in view and to possess corroborative evidence in support of their theory. he has been repeatedly tracked and traced, and is a  well known and wealthy resident of grosvenor square, the most fashionable quarter of london. a sensation of immense magnitude  is expected in connection with this matter.."

yard officials are right now in the midst of solving such a case.		this bridgeport fiend has, so far, manifested no desire to kill his victims, but merely to stab them and then take to flight. those who have seen him, for he has been pursued, though ineffectually, describe him as middle-aged and of an incredible fleetness of foot. his method is to spring suddenly out of the darkness, run at top speed upon some unsuspecting girl, plunge the needle-like point of a weapon into her chest or arm or throat, and then dart away into the shadow without once slackening his flight. 		in the latest case in bridgeport the ""ripper"" stabbed isabel parker, aged sixteen, in a department store at five o'clock in the afternoon. the girl was in the store, surrounded by hundreds of shoppers and clerks, when she felt a knife plunged into her side and back. she screamed, ""i've been stabbed!"" and then fainted, and was taken to a hospital. there was a scene of wild confusion in the store; nobody actually witnessed the incident, and the ""ripper"" escaped easily.		twenty-three times now has this terrifying, mysterious creature unsheathed his knife in bridgeport. twenty-three times have young women, and sometimes mere school children, been the victims of this man's fiendish attacks, and the police are still searching in vain for him.		in consequence, a measure of mute apprehension has taken hold of the community, for scarcely a girl feels safe if she ventures abroad after nightfall, even though she be not alone.		these attacks are ominously like echoes of the notorious atrocities in the whitechapel district of london, performed by london's famous ""jack the ripper,"" the first of the brutes to be so labelled. it was in this london slum district that he slew and mutilated his victims. there were seven of them, seven mounting horrors.		blue-blooded, conservative boston has not been exempt. she received a visit from a ""ripper"" and alberta ross, an eighteen-year-old girl, was attacked in a crowded cambridge street by a marauder, who made his escape.		new york has had more than its share of these ""ripper"" crimes, some as horrible as those of the british capital; paris has known them, as have berlin and canada. chicago and atlanta have been the scenes of similar attacks.		belvedere, n.j., knows the terror of the ""ripper,"" for helen becker, a school girl of that town, had her hair cut off by a maniac who jumped upon her from the underbrush as she was carrying milk cans.		but bridgeport's list of victims is a record and includes many young girls. catherine dillon, thirteen years old is one of these. she was stabbed in the breast with a sharp instrument. rose kerensky gave the police a vivid description of the mysterious maniac who attacked her. rose who is twelve years old, said she had a feeling that someone was following her several days before she was knifed.		mary dirgo is another of the girl victims of bridgeport's ""phantom stabber."" she is believed by the police to have been struck with an implement resembling an ice pick. she is sixteen, but like most of the other girl victims is mature beyond her age.		atlanta has a ""jack the ripper,"" all of whose victims were negro women. he worked his horrors in that city for two years and he murdered twenty of them. he was as methodical and cunning about his work as the london ""jack"" and possessed, too, quite knowledge of anatomy.		saturday night was the time invariably chosen for his crimes. he came upon his victims from behind and with a single stroke of a razor, supposedly, or with a surgeon's sharp knife, cut their throats.		berlin was baffled for an entire winter by a ""ripper."" one woman was killed by a stab wound in the abdomen, three were mortally wounded, fourteen seriously hurt, five slightly injured and eight merely scratched.		scotland yard is unraveling a ""strangler"" case even now. mrs. mary alice mottram, 21, wife of george edward mottram, miner, of sheffield, england, was murdered by strangulation. soon after the crime was committed the police intimated that they were anxious to interview a strange, tall, dark, middle-aged woman ""with a masculine voice"" who had been lurking in the neighborhood, and had expressed her determination to find a couple she was in search of, ""if she died in the attempt.""		then, with dramatic suddenness, a man surprised a policeman by voluntarily giving himself into custody and making a statement in regard to the murder. mrs. mottram had been done to death as she sat having her tea. a book, which she had been reading, was propped up on the table, and there were also the remains of a half-eaten meal. the dead woman's husband, who had been on the afternoon shifts at the colliery, leaving home about 1:30 p.m. and returning about 10:30 p.m., made the distressing discovery immediately on entering the house.		going into the kitchen, he saw his wife lying on her back with her head close to a table and her feet against the wall of the room. around her throat was a towel knotted and on top of it a piece of clothes line. it had two knots in it. everything was in its usual place and there were no signs of a struggle. the police and a doctor were called. the doctor certified that the woman had died of asphyxiation.		mrs. mottram, who had been married two years, had continued to work for a cutlery firm and had been so employed on the day of her murder. she had complained of late of not feeling well. she said her nerves were bad and she felt ""evil hanging over her,"" adding that she had not an enemy in the world and could not understand her feelings.		the man who surrendered to the police is samuel case, 24, a married miner, also of sheffield. he trembled violently when he appeared in court charged with the murder of mrs. mottram.		coincident with what the authorities take to be a new crime wave in great britain has come, on the part of authors, a revived interest in the dark deeds of england's past. just as, last year, the startling series of killings in the united states was artistically reflected in theodore dreiser's ""an american tragedy,"" which was a success in the theatre, so now memories of the notorious thompson-bywaters case have inspired an actor, frank vosper, to write its dramatic parallel in his play, ""surmise,"" or ""spellbound,"" as it was later called.		the slaying of percy thompson, morose husband of pretty edith thompson, by her 20-year-old lover, freddie bywaters is a murder classic. mrs. thompson and her sulky mate were returning from the theatre one night when bywaters, a roving sailor, set upon the man and fatally knifed him. the lord chamberlain forbade the production of the play in london, but it was done in the united states with the eminent actress, pauline lord, in the central role, and succeeded in further stirring up interest in the international crime waves of yesterday and today.		few ""rippers"" have been caught, but those that have, like all vainglorious evildoers, are found to be boastful of their acts. william hannaford, eighteen years old, arrested in boston during an epidemic of such horrors in that city, proudly asserted that he had attacked six girls in one week without being caught. he declared that the attacks were made because of ""an irresistible impulse.""		it is a sad list, this category of curious crimes, whose perpetrations, in the greater number of cases, have gone unpunished and it offers endless food for reflection. as one glances over the series of unsolved crimes, which extend back for a period of years one finds there deeds of horror that have spread over the land from the atlantic to the pacific and which also have been perpetrated equally as brutally in the countries across the sea.		the deeds of the ""rippers"" stand out strongly because they resemble each other to great degree, through varying the techniques of execution.		medical science explains that ""jack the ripper,"" ""jack the strangler,"" ""jack the stabber,"" ""jack the clipper"" is a person who is always mentally deficient. though he may appear in all respects normal, except when he is seized with the uncontrollable desire to commit an attack, he is nevertheless mentally unbalanced. it is a type of mental derangement that spasmodically occurs and numerous cases are on record of men of intellect and even genius who were seized by a desire, long slumbering in the unconscious mind, to commit such a depredation.		in many instances it is a case of ""dr. jekyll and mr. hyde,"" for the ""ripper"" may be a man of culture, possibly the father of a family whose children are the example of good behavior, but who from time to time has the terrible urge to see people suffer. not often, scientists state, do these men attack their own. education and age make little difference, for ""rippers"" of all ages and classes have been known.		deeds of ""jack the rippers"" recorded in criminal history have been bloodier than the mere ""cave man"" attacks of today. the darkest traditions of scotland yard have to do with the heinous whitechapel murders by ""jack the ripper,"" who ran at large many years ago. a whole literature of stories grew out of the whitechapel killings, now revived in the vicious and vigorous outbreak of clippings, stabbings and rippings on both sides of the atlantic, which, it almost seems, is practically the only place these masters do not choose for their playground.

possibly he had subjected them to awful tortures, and feasted on their groans until the approach of some one made him, in self-defense give them the finishing blow.the fourth unfortunate was killed on september 8th in a backyard in hambury (sic) street. the throat was cut and the head hung on by a piece of the vertebrae which had not been severed. the abdomen was ripped up and its contents made a fantasic decoration round the face of the corpse. it was the work of a butcher without doubt, or of a doctor practiced in carving the human cadaver.it was said that the madman wrote in blood on the wall: ""fifteen more before i surrender.""the fifth sacrifice was made at gateshead, near newcastle-on-tyne, on september 23. the circumstances were almost exactly the same as those attending the four previous murders.the sixth and seventh victims were killed this week in a similar manner.inspector byrnes on the london murdersamericans, with their prompt methods and their contempt for red tape, cannot understand the horrible murder of so many women in the whitechapel district of london.inspector byrnes, the famous new york detective, is worried over the inefficiency of the london police. he believes that one man committed all the whitechapel murders, and he thinks that he is a man of superior intelligence who is acting under the influence of a homicidal mania. the inspector says that the localization of the crimes and the fact that the victims all belong to the same class of women ought to make it easy to discover the criminal. his plan would be to manufacture victims for the murderer. that is, he would tempt him by scattering say fifty women over the whitechapel district, with a large force of disguised policemen at convenient points where they could see everything. in this way it is almost certain that the monster would be caught.the inspector says that such a series of crimes could not happen in new york or any other american city. by the time the second or third murder was committed the people would be in a fever of excitement and the police would be forced by public opinion to solve the mystery, or at least check the epidemic of slaughter.it will strike most people that the new york detective's plan is a good one, but perhaps he is mistaken when he says that so many murders, all of the same class, could not occur in an american city. how about austin, texas? about two years ago more than half a dozen women were mysteriously murdered in that town, preumably by the same man, and from that day to this the criminal has remained undiscovered."

[special]so intense is the feeling among all classes in london in regard to the bloody horrors, committed with impunity in whitechapel, that it is not surprising to hear of so prominent a member of parliament as colonel j. c. hughes-hallett, of her majesty's service, turning detective and visiting in disguise the perilous (sic) of the east end of the world's metropolis, with the deliberate intention of meeting, and if possible, apprehending the murderous monomaniac whose crimes have made the civilized world stand aghast.hughes-hallett's story.colonel hughes-hallett, who is staying at the breevort during his present visit to new york, gave a world reporter yesterday a thrilling account of his midnight visit to the scene of the monster's carnival of crime, made just after the commission of the second atrocity in that gory series which has drawn all eyes to the east end of london. said colonel hallett:""you may remember that the second of the mutilated bodies discovered in whitechapel was that of martha turner, a hawker, which was found on the second floor landing of the george yard buildings in commercial street, spitalfield. the similarity of the mutilation, the identity of the district and of the woman's occupation with those of the first victim, convinced me that i had to deal with a case of homicidal mania. i chose a bright, moonlight night for my expedition to whitechapel, just the kind of night that the thug whom i wanted to trail had a predilection for. i had already a theory of my own about the kind of man the assassin would turn out to be. i had more upon my mind, and i have seen since no reason to change it, that the perpetrator of these atrocities is a west end man, a gentleman, a person of wealth and culture perhaps, but certainly of intellectual qualities, finesse and keen discrimination.his motive? well, we will come to that presently. i was convinced that my man left his club, as i was then doing, and disguised himself for his hideous nocturnal revel as i was about to do.so i drove to my apartment and, doffing my evening dress, got into a plain, quiet pair of trousers [illegible] a rough [illegible] coat and a pot hat. i took plenty of money [illegible] but no jewelry of any kind [illegible] gave the driver orders to drive to [illegible] street.the man turned and looked at me in such a peculiar way that i am sure he suspected me. [illegible] had already been raised over town, for the second crime, by its singular atrocity, sent a chill of horror down every spine, and the police had given orders to the cabmen to watch suspicious 'fares'. the man said nothing, however, and i pretended not to notice his scrutiny. as we drove along st. james' park, i passed a very dear old friend and fellow clubman and looked him straight in the eye. he didn't know me, for being an amateur actor as well as a detective, i had 'made up' my face and completed the disguise effectually. the reason, or perhaps the main reason why i was convinced the murderer was a west end man, was the knowledge he had shown of surgery, or rather of anatomy; the thoroughness with which he did what he set out to do, and the finesse with which he instantly effaced himself and all tell-tale signs of his fearful work.i revolved these thoughts in my mind as i drove past cambridge music hall into commercial road, and i felt in my pocket to see that the revolver i had put there was ready for use. in the light of all the latter developments i have seen no cause for changing this opinion. i had now arrived as near the scene of action as i felt safe to go in a cab. midnight had struck, and the air was quiet and cool. i dismissed my cabby, looking him straight in the eye as i gave him my fare, and turned out of commercial road into whitechapel. the approaches to the scene of the maniac's operations are not particularly dirty, or filthy, or tumbledown, or, indeed, in any way calculated to attract unusual attention. but over them that night, and ever since, hung a brooding expectancy, a mysterious suggestion of something fearsome to be that could not fail to impress the most callous observer. as i walked from whitechapel into hanbury street, intending, by a round about route through the short streets and alleys connecting commercial road and hanbury street, to debouche into the latter, and thence into commercial street, where the last victim had been found.i was struck with the fact that the unfortunate women who frequent that district in swarms were, as i approached the scene of the tragedy, becoming rarer and rarer. i heard none of them singing or shouting their maudling endearments, or exhibiting, in the friskiness of their behavior, the reckless glee which is so repulsive in them. the sidewalks there, as in london generally, were in good order, and cleanly kept. in your slums here, or in a corresponding quarter of new york, you would find your gutters full of filthy water and refuse, and sidewalks unflagged, perhaps, or torn up, littered with dirt and shavings. i found nothing of this sort there. the houses on either side of those short streets are two and three stories high, brick dwellings, used below as shops. there are no porches in front of them, and no distinguishing marks of architecture about them. the pavements are of brick, of course, and in good order. the gas lamps were burning bright. and there was no evidence of the ramshackle and tumble-down lanes and alleys and culs de sac which one might suppose such a thug would choose for the scene of his operations.in the smaller streets between hanbury and whitechapel streets the gas lamps are, of course, not so near together. we do not plant them in london as you do here, with reference to the corners of the streets. at home they are regularly placed at certain intervals, whether at the intersection of streets or not, and just before reaching george's yard i saw what brought more forcibly than before to my mind the thrill of terror which pervaded the neighborhood. at the next corner, a stone's throw from where ""emma"" met her fate, stood a boby (sic), a policeman, you know, looking away from me. there were several women on the opposite side of the street, and a group of men. another policeman was just in the act of approaching them to move on, when, just in front of me, i heard a long drawn shivering sigh, an agonized catching of the breath, such as denots (sic) invariably mental agony or an extremity of terror. an unfortunate woman, not twenty feet away, was standing in the bright lamp light, reeling as if in the act of fainting. by a peculiar defect or blur in the lamp, her shadow was projected in a dead wall just to her right, with a misshapen distinctness which, in the unsettled condition of her nerves, was too much for her. she gave an awful shriek, and fell fainting to the ground. the police and passers (?) rushed up at once, and when she came to and told of the horrible shape she had seen at her elbow, congratulated her on her narrow escape from the fate which had befallen her sister in george's yard. she was hurried away and the search for the thug continued.just here i may say i would gladly give up my seat in parliament to become the head of the criminal investigation department in london, which never needed a head worse than now. our police officers and detectives are subordinated to the same authority where they should be separate and independent. a detective is born, not made by uniform, clubs, orders and a star on his breast. a detective may be a gentleman and should be a man of brains, culture and literary acquaintance. a policeman need only be obedient, string and brave. he may be, and after all, is densely stupid.so short is the distance from club land to the dens of the east end, that i had not been out on my expedition more than three quarters of an hour now, and i was already at the door of the house where the latest disemboweled and murdered woman had been found. there was not a soul in sight save a policeman a block away, watching the doorway as if he expected to see the fiend come out, hoofs, horns and all. i crossed the street to him, and after a great deal of persuasion he described the appearance of the latest victim, where she was found a few hours before, bleeding like an abattoir, and sliced to suit the murderer's purpose with anatomical accuracy.this brings one to my theory of who the thug is. i believe him to be an army doctor retired, perhaps, or a medical student, or a gentleman who has read medicine as amusement, or as a part of a liberal education. he is a man of the world, a gentleman, a club man, perhaps, who pursues his customary action during the day, and at night sallies out with his knife and dagger to feast a homicidal mania bred in him by disease, most likely contracted from some of the unfortunate women to whom he confines his horrible revenge. by the organs he has cut out and carried away, he proves himself a sexual pervert, that is the victim of a brain bias superinduced by the disease alluded to, and driving him to frenzy at stated intervals.he should be detected by his disposition of these organs. he may have burned them, but he has probably preserved them in his apartments to gloat over. while he will, no doubt, return to the same locality with each recurring frenzy to glut his revenge, he may never be caught there. i satisfied myself that it was no use to look for him there. he must be found at his home, in his club, in the fashionable thoroughfares of the west end. when these mutilated organs are found he will not be far away.""john paul bocock a white elephantwhich could not be found in a ten acre fieldan atlanta man who is crazy to catch the whitechapel murderer - his new theory and new plan.""the london police force, the devil! why, gentlemen, they could not find a white elephant in the middle of a ten acre field with an electric light!""this vivid exclamation trembled upon the drum of the detective reporter's ears as he meandered around beermann's corner yesterday.he stopped and turned.the word were shot with explosive utterance from the lips of a womanish-looking man whose very being seemed a flame with intense emotion.his face blushed. his small black eyes glittered. his white hands made zigzag gestures. his trim-buil, neatly-clad form quivered with excitement. his thin lips were cherry and purple in turn as he spoke, and the pale throat and his high, smooth and ashen brow presented a peculiar contrast to the regular girlish features and plump cheeks now reddened with passion.his voice was shrill and high, and he showed his white teeth like carker in the tale.he talked on.""i am sick of this balderdash about police detectives. why, i pick up the papers every day and within the past two weeks i have read of half a dozen murders committed right here in atlanta - and only one of the murderers apprehended. great heavens! what a showing. but these things don't interest me. i go in for bigger game.i was born with the detective fever, and at the age of thirty i am still shaking with it, and this whitechapel bloody work has made me almost wild. i read about it, i think about it, i dream about it, and to save me i can't talk ten minutes without talking about it.you will excuse my warmth, gentlemen, but the eyes of the world are turned upon the slums of whitechapel, london, and damn me if i don't believe i can catch the inhuman monster who is bathing his hands in the innocent blood of these poor, helpless women.why, just to think of it! he murdered one the other day just a few moments after a policeman had passed by; and the london dispatches say today that his last frail victim was horribly mangled and left within two blocks of scotland yard, which, we are told, turns out the best detectives on earth. he did this to dare the detectives in their den - but they won't even take a dare, ha!, ha! what a travesty, this, on armed authority. one murderer more than a match for whole platoons of so-called skilled detectives and the combined police power of the greatest city in the world!""as he said this his sneer was a study in contempt.""why don't you go to london and try your hand?""""simply because i am not able to have my business. but if the people of atlanta will make up a purse, i will go, and, as i said before, i firmly believe that the plan of action, now in my mind, could be worked to a successful issue.""""it would be a big thing for atlanta if you should go over and catch the whitechapel murderer. it would make you a perfect hero,"" said an interested listener.""yes,"" remarked another, ""and i believe if the women of atlanta really thought that you could capture the monster they would raise the money to send you over. women are more sympathetic than men, and all over this town they are taking a horrible interest in the butchering of females by this fiend incarnate.""""something tells me that i can do the work,"" continued the first speaker calmly, ""but it would be necessary for me to have at least a month's time. would you like to hear my theory on these murders and my plan of catching the murderer?""the crowd said that they were all attention.""well, my theory, gentlemen, is that the murderer is a woman-hater - a genuine woman-hater. i think that he has been treated cruelly by some woman whom he loved better than his left, and that he has sworn vengeance against the sex. he makes war to the knife on women, but his cunning hand is guided by a shrewd head. the times and places of his terrible work all show this to be true. i believe that he is a man fo means and perfectly sane, otherwise how could he jump from texas to london as he has done. if he had been a lunatic he would have been caught long ago. no, sir, he is a cool reasoner. why does he kill poor helpless abandoned women. for the best reason in the world. he knows that the world takes little interest in outcasts. therefore his chances to escape detection are better. suppose he should kill a society belle or a famous actress? aha! the risk would be too great, and he knows it. organized effort would be made to capture him and might succeed. so he picks his women - women that he knws the world thinks are better off dead - women without place or power or money or friends or homes - women over whose mutilated remains no tears will fall - women with no fathers, brothers, husbands, sons to protect or care for them. but this gluts his vengenace against the sex just the same.he is not a lady-killer - he's simply a woman butcher. that's my theory.now for my plan of action. if i had the money i would go to london, and take lodgings in the toughest part of whitechapel, in the immediate vicinity of these murders. i would pick out on the most heaven-forsaken of the women who live there and buy from her the clothes which she ordinarily wears. i understand the art of 'make up.' i would put on these clothes, make up my face to suit - in short, thoroughly disguise myself as one of these women and walk from dark till daylight about that vice hardened locality. i would go alone, and keep a keen lookout. you observe he kills women only when they are alone - not when they are walking around with people. when he tackled me, and i believe i could fool him into doing it, i would be too quick for him - that's all. i would hack him to pieces with a long, keen knife which i would carry concealed in the folds of my dress.""""but the nerve and the patience - have you got them to do it?"" asked a gentleman.""i have. and i tell you the solemn truth when i say that nothing in life would give me greater delight than to undertake the job. i would rather catch or kill that murderer of helpless women than to have one million dollars - and i am willing to go into a notary this minute and make affidavit to it.""with these words the young, womanish-looking man smiled and bowed to the crowd, and walked hurriedly down the street.they all know him - and all believed everything that he had said.that whitechapel murdererhe is the greatest criminal in the world today, and possibly the greatest the world has ever known.but who is he?that is the question which the whole civilized world is asking.is he a common thug, with a homicidal mania, who sneaks from his hiding place at night to commit his horrible crimes?is he some medical student, some retired army or navy doctor, some person who has studied medicine and is now endeavoring to prove some pet theory or other, and takes this altogether horrible way of doing it?is he some crank, wrapped up in the belief that it is his mission to rid the world of the worthless women whose lives he has taken?is he the loathsome, fiendish mr. hyde of some highly respectable dr. jekyll - some man, as sir hughes-hallett suggests, who moves in society, a club man, perhaps, and highly respected, where only the better part of his dual life is known?he might be any one of these. there are only two things certain about this sensational affair - that the crimes are the most horrible the world has known, and that the london police has proved itself incapable of grasping the situation. the murderer and his murders form the sole topic of conversation everywhere.but who is he?"

diabolical butcheriesfrom the cincinnati enquirer.london, november 9.another shocking murder of the well known whitechapel type was perpetrated this morning within three hundred yards of the spot where the woman chapman was killed last september. details of this tragedy are even more revolting than the six which preceded it. accurate circumstances of the affair are hard to discover, the police, as usual, placing every obstacle in the way of investigation by reporters but all reports go to prove that the murder is far surpassing infiendish atrocityall the terrible crimes with which the east end of london has been familiarized within the past six months. the woman, twenty six years old, mary jane kelly by name, had lived four months in a front room on the second floor of a house up an alley known as cartin's court. this poor woman was in service a short time ago, but since she came to reside in the court had been recognized by her neighbors as a person who, like so many unfortunate members of her sex within the eastern end of the town, managed to live a wretched existence by the practice of immorality under the most degrading conditions.the court faces a small square with a narrow entrance and surrounded by squalid lodging houses let to women of this unfortunate class. mary kelly is described as a tall woman, not bad looking, dark complexioned, and she generally wore an old black velvet jacket. she was wearing this jacket this morning, when about quarter past eight she went down the court, jug in hand, and returned shortly afterward with milk for breakfast. she was next seen about ten o'clock, when she went to a neighboring beer house and stayed drinking for half an hour. this wasthe last seen of her alive.the woman was behind in her rent, and had been told by her landlord that she would be put out if she did not pay today. she went on the streets last night to earn money to pay the rent, and it seems to be clearly established that she returned to her room with a man who passed the night with her. no one has been found who saw the man go in, but some neighbors heard him talking to mary kelly in the room, and heard her singing as though drunk. at eleven o'clock this morning a man named bowyer, agent of the landlord, went to kelley's (sic) room to collect the rent. when he knocked at the door he received no answer. removing the curtain drawn across the window of the room and looking through the broken pane, he saw the woman lying on the bed on her back, stark naked, while marks of blood were all over the place. he tried the handle of the door and found it locked, while the key had been removed from the lock. without going into the room, bowyer called the police, who promptly proceeded toconceal all the facts in the case.in less than two hours the doctors had the body in the morgue, and were probing it precisely as they did the mitre square victim. they refused to give any details of the examination, but one of the physicians who was present said that he had passed much of his life in dissecting rooms, but never saw such a horrible spectacle as this murdered woman.the man who was called in to identify the body gives the following description, which seems to be reliable: the head was nearly severed from the shoulders and the face was lacerated almost beyond recognition. the breasts were both cut off and placed on the table. the heart and liver were between the woman's legs. the uterus was missing. there seemed to be at least forty cuts on the body, and bog pieces of flesh were literally stripped off and strewed on the floor. there were no indications in this case of a hand skilled in the use of a knife.the body was literally hacked to piecesbut there is no doubt at all that it was the work of the person who has become known throughout the world as the whitechapel murderer. mystery in this case is as deep as in the preceding crimes. the fiend got away without leaving the slightest clew.he chose his time well. at the moment which bowyer discovered the murdered body, that gorgeous annual nuisance, which goes by the name of the lord mayor's show, was blocking the traffic of the great city for hours, and was organizing near the mansion house. scarcely a mile away nearly three million people were packed in the streets between the mansion house and the enquirer office in trafalgar square, with nearly every policeman in the city braced as a barricade along the curb to keep them in order. the rigid police patrol maintained in whitechapel since the last double murder in october was relaxed for one day, and in that day the assassin struck down another victim.it is scarcely necessary to say much about kelly. she was a married woman who fell into dissolute ways, and was deserted by her husband. she had a boy eleven years old, who was begging on the streets while his mother was being murdered. the woman had as a paramour a man who sells oranges on the streets, and on whom, as he could not be found, suspicion at once reverted, but he turned up all right tonight and fainted when he was shown the body.like the sand that slowly filter through an hour glass when reversed, the great throng in the streets who had been cheering the new lord mayor found their way into whitechapel when the news of the murder was spread about. every heart was filled with horror. when was this going to end? how long was this fiend in human form going to carve people to pieces under the noses of the police and mock their feeble efforts to catch him? the london police are not allowed to club a crowd into submission as the new york police are, unless in absolute riot, but the indignation and excitementwas so great in whitechapel today that it was necessary for them to use harsh measures.profiting by previous blunders the police called a photographer to take a picture of the room before the body was removed from it. this gives rise to reports that there is more handwriting on the wall, though three or four people who were allowed into the room say they did not observe it; but possibly they were too excited to notice such a detail.a young woman who knew the murdered woman well says that about ten o'clock last night she met her and that she said she had no money and could not get any. she would never go out any more, but would do away with herself. soon after they parted, and a man, who is described as respectably dressed, came by and spoke to the murdered woman and offered her money. the man then accompanied her to her lodgings her little boy was removed from the room and taken to a neighbor's house. the boy has been found and corroborates this but says he does not remember the man's face.another curious circumstance worth mentioning is that the murder was not made public until twelve o'clock.mrs. paumier, who seems to be a creditable person, sells walnuts in sandy's row, near to the scene of the murder. she states that at eleven o'clock today a respectably dressed man, carrying a black bag, cam up to her and begantalking about the murder.he appeared to know everything about it. he did not buy any walnuts, and, after standing a few, went away. mrs. paumier describes him as a man about thirty years old and five feet six inches in height. he wore speckled trousers and a black coat. several girls in the neighborhood say the same man accosted them and they chaffed him. when they asked him what he had in the black bag he said: ""something the ladies don't like."" that is all that is known. if the police have further information they carefully conceal it, but there is no reason to believe that they have."

all indications point to one of the most sensational murder trials on record. the police hint at still more damaging letters given up by brierly. medical men will be called to say that they were not consulted till too late to prevent the poison from taking fatal effect. it is rumored that mrs. maybrick will claim that her husband poisoned himself by taking an overdose of medicine with arsenic in it.mrs. maybrick's mother.a lady of many husbands and some queer adventures.mobile, ala., may 31.carrie e holbrook-chandler, the mother of mrs. james maybrick, is a woman with a very romantic career. miss holbrook came to mobile about 1856, visiting her uncle, the rev. j h ingraham, rector of st john's church, author of the ""prince of the house of david"" etc. she was very popular in society, being a good conversationalist, handsome and prepossessing. among her admirers was young william g chandler, sone of daniel chandler, one of the leading lawyers of the city. he followed her to her home in new york city, where they were married. returning to mobile they lived in good style, and mrs. chandler increased her influence in society. she was even as much of a belle as before her marriage.it was at the beginning of the civil war that frank du barry turned up, being a captain in the ordnance department of the confederate government. captain du barry was a remarkably dashing young officer. soon there was some talk of his attentions to the lady. suddenly mr. chandler fell ill and died. some suspicious circumstances surrounded his illness. mrs. chandler did not attend the funeral. there were no official investigation of the charge, but it affected her position, which became so unpleasant that she took her two children and moved to macon, ga. in less than a year she married du barry there.shortly afterwards du barry was ordered to go to europe as representative of the confederate government. he and his family took passage on a blockade runner out of charlestown or savannah, it it not known which, and had proceeded but a couple of days when du barry, who had been ailing, suddenly died. the captain of the steamer proposed to return to port but the widow strenuously insisted that the vessel should continue and that the body be cast overboard. this was done and the vessel reached england in due time.in a year or two mrs. chandler drifted back to new york, where she was involved in a scandal with some actor. after this she went again to europe, where she met and married baron von rogue. it is said he was not faithful to her, and at one time gave her  beating, so she left him.when last heard from the woman was filling the position of wife of an attaché of the british legation at teheran, persia. since she left mobile the chandler family here have had nothing to do with her."

reported from sandy hook, elliott county, kentucky. a young lady who had discouraged the suit of a rustic admirer was enticed to an out of the way part of the county, dragged to the woods and killed, after having been chained a few days in a deserted cabin. like the willshire girl, the victim had been employed in teaching school and had no other protector than an aged mother.""mrs. maybrick againalthough she is an american woman, a native of mobile, mrs. florence maybrick has found numerous strong friends in england who are doing their best to get her out of prison.it will be recollected that mr. maybrick, the liverpool cotton merchant, died in 1889, and the autopsy showed traces of arsenical poisoning. his unhappy wife was arrested, convicted and sentenced to death, but the penalty was subsequently commuted to imprisonment for life.the conviction of mrs. maybrick was due to several unfortunate circumstances. it was proved that she administered arsenic to mr. maybrick. it was in evidence that she was carrying on a love intrigue with a mr. brierly. justice stephen, who presided, charged strongly against her, and exerted himself to secure her conviction.now, for the other side. maybrick used arsenic habitually, not only in england, but before he left this country. he dosed himself, and requested his wife to give him the drug. the hotel waiter who testified to mts. maybrick's intimacy with brierly now solemnly states that he could not identify that lady and brierly in court as the parties he had seen in the hotel, but was ordered by the police to swear that he recognized them. he obeyed orders, and now expresses his great regret for the harm that resulted from his testimony. one more point in the prisoner's favor. justice stephen has recently shown such unmistakeable signs of insanity that he has been forced to retire from the bench. this leads many to the conclusion that his strange anxiety to convict mrs. maybrick showed that his mind was unbalanced at that time. mr. alexander macdougall, a well known english lawyer, has written a book entitled ""the maybrick case"", which contains the following dedication:""this work is dedicated to james chandler maybrick, aged eight years, and gladys evelyn maybrick, aged four years, by the author, with the sincere hope that it will enable them to feel during their lives that the word 'mother' is not 'a sound unfit to be heard or uttered' by them, and that when they are old enough to be able to understand this record of the facts and circumstances connected with the charge put upon and the trial of florence elizabeth maybrick, aged twenty seven, her children may have, throughout their lives, the comfort of feeling that their mother was not proved to be guilty of the murder of their father, james maybrick.""mr. macdougall is chairman of a committee which is endeavoring to secure mrs maybrick's pardon upon the grounds above stated. he closes his book with the following: ""those who, like myself, after a deliberate study of the evidence (which i have honestly endeavored to lay exhaustedly before my readers) call her guiltless, must feel shame as long as a guiltless woman is passing a living death in our midst, and i invite every one who feels that shame to join in every legitimate effort to carry out the following programme:1) mrs. maybrick's release from prison as a matter of right and as an acknowledged innocent woman.2) the removal from office of all those who can be shown by their unconstitutional conduct to have been responsible for the miscarriage of justice which has taken place.3) the bringing to justice of any persons who can be shown to have recklessly and maliciously put the charge of murdering her husband upon mrs. maybrick.""it will be seen that all the important testimony against this lady was either doubtful or perjured, and that the presiding judge was probably crazy. if these are not good grounds for a pardon, it is difficult to see what more could be required.what adds interest to the case if the fact that the prisoner is closely related to some of the best families in alabama and georgia. many prominent southerners have signed a petition in her behalf, and the circumstances justify the hope that she may soon be released from prison and restored to her children."

the year of the ripper crimes - he went to live in george yard, whitechapel, where the first of the famous murderer's many women victims was found dead, and that this was his home during all the time when the assassinations were being committed. at the trial, too, a woman named lucy braderski (sic), whom the police had discovered and who proved to have been the murderer's first and real wife, testified that he had once attempted to kill her with a long knife - precisely such as weapon as that with which the ripper is supposed to have mutilated his victims. the woman also testified that she and klosowski once made a trip to the united states and lived there for several months. soon after returning to this country they separated.since klosowski's conviction, scotland yard, whose officials never have taken any stock in the cries that the ripper was dead, or a lunatic, but who always have hoped to wipe off a stain on their record by nabbing him, have been working quietly on the clew thus gained.it is f.g. abberline, former chief detective inspector of the scotland yard forces, who now declares publicly his conviction that klosowski was the ripper. and ex-inspector abberline is the exact man who might be expected to take the greatest interest in this part of the murderer's record, as he it was who had charge of criminal investigations at the time of the whitechapel crimes.briefly, these are the reasons which the retired sleuth hound has just given to the present commissioner of police for his belief that klosowski's arrival in london and residence in whitechapel was coincidental with the beginning and duration of the ripper murders.then, there is the circumstance, which was brought out at the murderer's trial, that he studied medicine in russia and was once an assistant surgeon, one of the features of the ripper murders was the horrible precision with which the assassin's victims were mutilated - which at the time gave the idea that the criminal must be a physician.at klosowski's trial, too, it was stated that, when he lived in whitechapel, he was in the habit of wearing a peaked cap. such a cap was worn by the ripper. the ripper, like klosowski, was a man of middle height, and it is stated also that each of the few persons who claimed to have seen the whitechapel murderer, described him as a ""foreign looking man.""there is also the circumstance that klosowski once attempted to kill the only one of his wives who escaped from him alive by attacking her with a knife. but what has impressed ex inspector abberline most strongly of all is the fact that toward the end of 1888 klosowski went to the united states to live. for one of the most sensational developments of the ripper mystery was that, shortly after the murders ceased in whitechapel, a series of crimes of the same sort began in america. at the time it was supposed that some american pervert merely had been inspired to imitate the london assassin example.there is still another  link in the chain with which, as the author of the whitechapel murders, the ex scotland yarder is seeking to forge about the pole, klosowski, and curiously enough, it also is particularly of interest to americans.""while the coroner was investigating one of the east end murders,"" says ex inspector abberline, ""he told the jury a very queer story. you will remember that the divisional surgeon, who made the post mortem examination, not only spoke of the skilfullness with which the knife had been used, but stated that there was overwhelming evidence to show that the criminal had so mutilated the body that he could possess himself of one of the organs. the coroner, in commenting on this, said that he had been told by the subcurator of the pathological museum connected with one of the great medical schools that some few months before an american had called upon him and asked him to procure a number of specimens. he stated his willingness to give $100 for each. although the strange visitor was told that his wish was impossible of fulfillment, he still urged his request. it was known that the request was repeated at another institution of a similar character in london. the coroner at the time said: 'is it not possible that a knowledge of this demand may have inspired some abandoned wretch to possess himself of the specimens? it seems beyond belief that such inhuman wickedness could enter into the mind of any man; but, unfortunately, our criminal annals prove that every crime is possible!'""it is a remarkable thing,"" mr. abberline pointed out, ""that after the whitechapel horrors america should have been the place where a similar kind of murder began, as though the miscreant had not fully supplied the demand of the american agent."" it was only yesterday that the veteran scotland yarder's remarkable theory was made public, and at this time it cannot be said what steps will be taken toward confirming it. when convicted of the poisoning of his three wives, klosowski, who so far had assumed a careless attitude, broke down completely and wept as sentence was being passed upon him. his lawyer who visited him in the condemned cell the other day, reported that the criminal was employed in writing out a lengthy statement of some kind, so that there is a possibility that klosowski has decided to reveal himself as one of the most famous of modern criminals and is the man of all men upon whom the london police have, since the commission of the ghastly series of butcheries in whitechapel, been most anxious to lay their hands."

promise of yielding something definite, but so far no arrests have been made. the stone which was used as a weapon was found in a nearby field. the woman's shoes are missing, and have not been found. the trail of the slayer could be traced only a short distance in the soft dirt.monday's murder is one of the series which has the police at sea, and which is causing consternation throughout the negro population. meetings have been held in all the churches, the murderers denounced, and rewards offered, but there seems to be no stop to the crimes.first one early in yearlooking back over the murders, it is seen that they have not started recently, but only in the last two months have they gained such frequency and regularity as to attract universal notice. the first one, ""negro woman murdered, throat cut by unknown persons,"" happened during the latter part of 1910.on february 19 an unknown woman was found near grant park with her head crushed and her throat cut. on january 22 rosa trice had been killed near gardner street and the southern railway in the same manner.from june 19 on there has been one murder weekly, starting with addie watts, who was found near railroad, her head mashed with a coupling pin andher throat cut. june 25 saw lizzie watts killed at white and lawton streets, her body hidden in a clump of bushes. lena sharpe was murdered july 1 at 24 hanover street, and her daughter emma lou stabbed. emma lou has given the only description that the police have of the man. the unknown of monday night completes the list.the present crime wave is not confined alone to the negro sections.a wave of crimeout in the best residence sections of the city a series of robberies, which have amounted to several thousand dollars' worth of fine jewels and glassware, have been committed by sneak thieves and burglars. in some cases citizens have been providing  special guards for their homes.among the robberies which have taken place are: charles l gately, $1,400; charles a conklin, $500; george m brown, $300; j g oglesby, $300; howard candler, $300, and others.the servant theory of the police has been dissipated by the sneak thief at the oglesby home monday morning, and it is generally admitted now that the robberies are the work of one gang. whether they are white or black is not known. it is possible that the city has been invaded by a number of professional crooks, who are making rich hauls.so far there is no evidence to connect anyone with the robberies, and the police are at sea with regard to the burglaries.want reward offeredin the hope of securing the arrest of the ripper, negro pastors of atlanta have started a petition asking the governor and mayor to offer a reward for his capture. it is as follows:""within the last two years seventeen colored women have been found murdered in this community as follows:april 5, 1909, della reid, found dead in trash pile near 71 rankin street.september 7, 1909. unknown, found dead in

she saw him in full light and in the dark; she heard him speak, and her verdict was that he was the man to the best of her knowledge. her identification was not positive, however, stated chief jennings, who was an interested observer.""how you gittin' 'long?"" henderson was told to say, and as he spoke the girl shrank back, as if she recognized the voice that had threatened her at the time of her mother's murder.the partial identification of the sharpe woman is greatly strengthened by that of a clerk in a grocery store near 24 hanover street, where the crime was committed, who saw henderson on the night of the murder. his identification was practically the same as that of emma lou sharpe.jim patton, a negro, was in cone's drug store, corner of pryor and decatur streets, monday night, when henderson went in accompanied by the holley woman and made a small purchase. this was after 11 0'clock, and is a strong link in the evidence. the negro's statements are verified by dr. cone and one of the clerks.evidence is strong.the circumstantial evidence against henderson is most strong, declared the detectives last night. he was positively seen with the holley woman after 11 o'clock monday night, but has denied even knowing her. they say he has involved himself in a network of lies regarding his movements on the night of the crime and subsequent to it.a significant fact is that henderson's shoe fits to the fraction of an inch the tracks left in the soft mud at the scene of the murder.""mr. bullard, you ain't 'rested me for nothin', but i live out there where this woman was killed,"" asserted todd as he was taken from his cell last night by the detectives to be carried upstairs for identification.""if that was the case, todd,"" answered mr. bullard, ""i would have gotten you long ago. half a dozen negroes have been killed within half a mile of where you live.""henderson lives at the west point belt line crossing of hill street, near where sadie holley was found with her throat cut and her head crushed with a coupling pin, not far from the woods beyond grant park, where an unknown was murdered, and some little distance from the negro section where two others met their fates.cut up his wife.""well sir, you know if i was goin' to kill anybody i would long ago have killed my wife,"" continued the prisoner.henderson has been in a great deal of trouble on account of his wofe, whom he is said to have cut up two or three times. when he was arrested he was in a beer saloon spying on her while she paid a visit to a friend in the police station.henderson fills very well the description given weeks ago by the sharpe girl - a tall and powerful negro - but his clothes, of course, are different. he works for various persons in town, sodding grass and such jobs, and makes good wages.henry huff, who was the first negro locked up, was arrested at his home, rear of 81 brotherton street, and the damaging fact against him was his blood-soaked and dirty trousers. he had a wound on the head, the result of a pool room fight, which he claimed caused the blood.last night detectives coker and mcgill found on his right arm, in the crook of his elbow, a group of marks that are seemingly finger nail scratches. he claims they are old marks. circumstantial evidence has also been secured against him.the coroner's inquest over the body of sadie holley will be held this morning at 9 o'clock.governor is petitioned.spurred to action by the ruthless slaughter of seventeen negro women in atlanta and vicinity, whose murderers have gone unwhipped of justice, a large number of citizens, both white and colored, yesterday petitioned governor smith to offer rewards for the apprehension of the perpetrators of these crimes.the petition was circulated by rev. h h proctor and several other negro ministers of the city.

but the surroundings are debasing in the extreme; there is no resisting them.  dozens, scores, of these miserable creatures are absolutely homeless.  nobody cares for them, few know them by sight, and fewer still know them by name.  they are the most abject of all creatures on earth.cases in outcast london.one of the features of whitechapel is the socialists' club.  it is located in cleaver's yard, not far from where one of the murders was committed.there is a brighter side to whitechapel life, however, of which but little has been written.  the rector of st. mary's, rev. a. j. robinson, has done wonderful work among the east end poor.  he by no means confines his efforts to preaching.  he works and lives among the people, has clubs and classes for them, and brightens their lives in a hundred ways; and, curious to relate, he has a large personal following among the jews.  outside his church is an open air pulpit, the only one in england, where services are regularly held, and in the summer evenings no less than 300 rough looking people are ever in attendance there.rev. s. a. barnett, of st. jude's, is another earnest worker among the masses of whitechapel, and he, too, works in a thoroughly practical direction.  so, too, do the oxford men at toynbee hall, an institution not unlike the one that robert elsmere gave his life to establish.  the bishop of wakefield, in an admirable article in the fortnightly review, throws what to most people will be a new light on east end life, and takes an optimistic view.  he does not believe, with the writer of ""the bitter cry of outcast london,"" that ""the poor are getting poorer, the wretched more wretched and the wicked more wicked,"" and he declares, indeed, that ""nothing can be more diametrically opposed to the fact.""  as a former east end clergyman and a worker among the poor, he may be credited with a clear personal knowledge of his subject.  ""i have,"" he says, ""met with no one who has known east london for the last twenty years who is not perfectly clear as to the great improvement that has taken place in every direction.""but how terrible the east end must have been twenty years ago!  it seems impossible that it could ever have been worse than it is today.  the bright spots of st. mary's, st. jude's and toynbee hall are but small oases in the vast desert of whitechapel misery and dirt and vice.  what the east end needs is emigration.  but who wants emigrants from the east end?  surely not the american people, who have among them enough of this sort, and to spare.  but whitechapel is overcrowded.  and, to make bad matters worse, its dense population, growing denser daily by natural (or ought one to say ""unnatural"") causes, is increased constantly by an influx of poverty from the continent."

""deep searching of hearts, humiliation of spirit, and sorrowful reflections over the causes which make these unspeakable atrocities possible,"" are the solemn words with which the london times of november 10 concluded a leading editorial on the tragedy of the day before. ""so tens of thousands of us live now in the greatest city of the world,"" sorrowfully remarks the daily news.	it may be that the divine providence, which is evermore bringing forth good out of evil, will cause to spring up, from the unparalleled horror with which the whitechapel murders have inspired the public mind of london, a determination to cleanse that loathsome ulcer upon the body politic. possibly multitudes who have neither known nor cared how other multitudes of their fellow creatures lived, will care now that they cannot help knowing. the bishop of bedford has set on foot a movement to establish in whitechapel an institution to be called the ""home and refuge."" lady kinnaird is using her great social influence in the west end to interest women of wealth and rank to do something for the material and moral improvement of society in the east end. too much cannot be done, and it cannot be done too soon."

in the record of criminal history have the police of any country been called upon to unravel a mystery so complete as that which now enshrouds the famous whitechapel murders in the east end of london.  up to this time seven victims have fallen under the skilful knife of an unknown fiend, and there remains not a particle of a clew on which to hang a hope of discovery of the murderer.from beginning to end the tragedies have been marked by many circumstances and inexplicable details which fill all with terror and dismay the eager scotland yard detectives.  one after another the mutilated bodies of the victims of this mysterious demon have been picked up on the most populous thoroughfares, but no one has seen the murderer, and the police know not where to turn to begin the task of discovery.in every case the unmistakable handiwork of the same fiend is too painfully apparent to admit of doubt.  madman he probably is, but with all his boldness he is possessed of a cruel cunning which allows him to stalk about the public highways, striking down his victims as he pleases, and leaving not even the faintest clew to his personality.  until more is known of the murderer no conception can be formed of the object of his horrible crimes, unless it is reasonable to at once conclude that it is the work of a maniac.  to accredit those murders to a desire for anatomical experiments, and to attempt to roughly guess that some american collector is at work, as coroner baxter thinks, is the imagination of an imbecile.  whatever the objects of these wholesale murders and whoever the murderer may be, every civilized nation waits in anxious suspense for the horrible mystery to be solved.the first of what have now become famous asthe whitechapel murdersoccurred somewhat less than 12 months ago in that section of london where the scum of the vile dens of vice are turned loose upon the streets when the police close the brothels at early morning, and the floating population of criminals and fallen women continue their revels undisturbed.  although the first victim was a woman of the lowest class, and her body was mutilated in the same shocking manner that has characterized the recent murders, nothing more than a passing notice was given the affair by the police.  a murder was no uncommon occurrence in whitechapel, and the very fact that the victim was a blear-eyed, gin-soaked unfortunate, led the authorities to believe that she had quarrelled with one of her own associates, and the matter had ended as many as drunken quarrel had ended there before.  the policeman on the post was closely questioned, his immediate superior viewed the remains and the coroner observed  that the crime was one of shocking brutality.  the london press commented a little, the case dropped from the attention of the police, and the first of the whitechapel murders passed out of mind.on tuesday, aug. 7, the body ofmartha turner, a hawkerwas found lying upon the first floor landing of the dwellings known as george yard buildings, commercial street, spitalfields, whitechapel district.  the previous day was what is known as bank holiday, and it was late in the evening of that day that the murder was committed.  when the body was found, it was horribly mutilated after the manner of the first victim.  the hand of the murderer was clearly seen to be the same in both cases.  as nearly as the police could determine both victims had been seized from behind by a powerful arm, and their throats cut by a swift stroke from some razor-edged knife.  such was the force of this death-blow, and such the keenness of the weapon, that the head was almost severed from the body, and the knife had even left its imprint upon the bone at the back of the neck.but more remarkable than the ghastly work at the throat was the discovery that the woman had received no less than 39 distinct, deep and clear cuts upon various parts of her body.  from these wounds the blood had poured forth, saturating her clothes and covering the steps on which she lay with aslippery coating of coagulated blood.examination of the body revealed the same indescribable mutilation that had marked the first murder.  the underclothing had been thrown roughly up over the shoulders and a jagged wound crossed the bowels, laying bare the intestines.  below this a portion of the womans body had been cut out with the nicety and skill of a surgeons knife, leaving only a quivering and bleeding aperture.  the police jumped to the conclusion that the murderer had saved the part removed for an anatomical collection.  several friends of the victim were arrested and held for the coroner, but little was found that cast any light upon the crime.  at the inquest mary ann connelly, pearly poll, was called, but inspector reid of the police asked that she might be cautioned previous to being sworn.  this the coroner did, and she said that she had been lodging at a lodging-house in dorset street.  she was a single woman, and gained her livelihood on the street. she had known the deceased four or five months, under the name of emma.the last time she saw her alivewas on bank holiday, at the corner of george yard, whitechapel.  they went to a public house together, and parted about 11.45.  they were accompanied by two soldiers, one a private and the other a corporal.  she did not know to what regiment they belonged, but they had white bands round their caps.  witness did not know if the corporal had any side arms.  they picked up the soldiers together and entered several public houses, where they drank.  when they separated the deceased went away with the private.  they went up george yard, while witness and the corporal went up angel alley.before they parted witness and the corporal had a quarrel, and he hit her with a stick.  she did not hear deceased have any quarrel.  witness never saw the deceased again alive.  deceased was a woman who did not drink much.  witness had tried to identify the two men at one of the barracks, where the men were paraded before her.  she picked out two men who she thought were the same that were with her and the deceased on the night of the murder.  that was at wellington barracks.  shehad never seen the men before.witness left the corporal at the corner of george yard about 5 or 10 minutes past 12, and afterwards went along commercial street towards whitechapel.  she heard no screams, and was first informed of the murder of tuesday.that was all that the authorities succeeded in ascertaining in regard to whitechapels second horror.the public had scarcely recovered from the shock of this murder in the east end of london, when a second atrocity of an exactly similar kind occurred at whitechapel, in this instance, also, a woman was the victim.  the throat was cut open from ear to ear, and the lower part of the abdomen was completed ripped up, with the bowels protruding, the wound extending nearly to her breast.the brutality of the murder is beyond conception, and beyond description.  the throat was cut in two gashes, the instrument having been a sharp one, but used in a most ferocious and reckless way.  there was a fash under the left ear, reaching nearly to the centre of the throat.  along half its length, however, it was accompanied by another one, which reached around under the uother ear, making a wide and horrible hole,and nearly severing the head from the body.  the ghastliness of this cut, however, paled into insignificance alongside the other.  no murder was ever more ferociously and more brutally done.  the knife, which must have been a large and sharp one, was jabbed into the deceased at the lower part of the abdomen and then drawn upwards twice.  it was evident that the murder was committed some distance from the place where the body was found.  this was in bucks row, about midway its length.  bucks row is a short street occupied half by factories and half by dwellings.  half way down the street is the house of mrs. green.  next to it is a large stable yard, whose wide, closed gateway is next to the house.  in front of the gateway the woman was found.  constable neil, who was the first person to see the body, immediately after awoke the green family and asked them if they had heard any unusual noise.  neither mrs. green, her son, nor her daughter, all of whom were sleeping within a few feet of where the body lay, hadheard any outcry.all agreed that the night was unusually quiet.i should have heard it had there been any, said mrs. green when interviewed, for i have trouble with my heart and am a very light sleeper.another person, a mrs. perkins, who lives across the way from mrs. greens house, also denied having heard any sounds of disturbance in the street during the night.there are, however, a number of people who contradicted these statements, and say that they distinctly heard the screams of a woman early on the morning of the crime.  a mrs. conville, who lives near the place, said: i was wakened early on friday morning by my little girl, who said someone was trying to get into the house.  i listened and heard screams.  they were in a womans voice, and, though frightened, were faint-like, as would be natural if she were running.  she was screaming murder, police! murder, police!  she screamed this give or six times, and seemed to be getting further away all the time.  i heard no other voice and no other steps.  she seemed to be all alone.  i think i would have heard the steps if anybody had been running after her, unless they wererunning on tiptoe.the scotland yard detectives at once searched everywhere in the vicinity in the hope of discovering some clew.  none was found.  in fact, everything seemed to indicate that the murder was committed some distance away, as drops of blood were found along the sidewalk; but what perplexed the police most was the fact that the blood stains were found on both sides of the street.  the body of the unfortunate woman was removed to the mortuary, and steps were taken to have it identified, but at first with little prospect of success.  some of the clothing bore the stamp of the lambeth workhouse.  this, however, afforded little assistance, as clothing is distributed at the workhouse to any poor people who apply for it.  a comb and a piece of looking-glass found in the pocket led the police to believe the murdered woman was an inhabitant of one of the common lodging-houses in the neighborhood.  officers were despatched to make inquiries here, and eventually some women from a lodging-house at 18 thrawl street, spitalfields, were found who identified the body as that of polly,as she was called, who shared a room with three unfortunates in the house on the usual terms of fourpence a night.on the night of the murder she was turned out of the house because she had not the money.  she was then a little the worse for drink, and said to a companion as she turned away, ill soon get my doss money.  see what a jolly bonnet ive got now.  the lodging-house people only knew her as polly, but later a woman from the lambeth workhouse identified her as mary ann nicholls, aged 42.  the deceased woman had been an inmate of the workhouse and had left it to take a situation as a domestic servant, but after a short time absconded with £3 of her employers money.  from that time she had wandered about the streets.the police theory was at that time that a sort of high-up gang existed in the neighborhood which, blackmailing women of the unfortunate class, takes vengeance on those who do not find money for them.the fourth murderrivalled in many respects any of the preceding horrors, and, like the rest, showed at a glance the same hand and the same mysterious purpose in its details of mutilation and methods.  she was, like the others, one of the citys unfortunates, and had led the same life, among the same associates, and in the same section of the city.at a spot only a few hundred yards from where the mangled body of the poor woman nichols was found just a week before, the body of another woman, mutilated and disfigured, was found at 5.30 on saturday morning.  she was lying in the back of 29 hanbury street, a house occupied by mrs. richardson, a packing-case maker.  as late as 5 oclock on saturday morning, it is said, the woman was drinking in a public house near at hand called the ten bells.  near the body was discovered a rough piece of iron, sharpened like a knife.  the wounds upon the woman were more fearful than those found upon the body of the woman nicholls, who was buried on thursday.  the throat was cut in a most horrible manner and the stomach terribly mutilated.the discovery of the body was made by john davies, living on the top floor of 29 hanbury street, sept. 8, in the yard of which the body was found.  mr. davies was crossing the yard between 5 and 6, when he saw a horrible looking mass lying in the corner, partly concealed by the steps.  he instantly made for the station and notified the police, without touching the body.  meantime mrs. richardson, an old lady, sleeping on the first floor front, was aroused by her grandson, charles cooksley, who looked out of one of the back windows and screamed that there was a dead body in the corner.mrs. richardsons description makes this murder even more horrible than any of its predecessors.  the victim was lying on her back, with her legs outstretched.  her throat was cut from ear to ear.  the abdomen was exposed, the body having been ripped up, exposing the intestines.  no more horrible sight ever met a human eye, for she was covered with blood and lying in a pool of it.mr. and mrs. davies occupy the upper story of 29 hanbury street, the house consisting of two stories.  when mr. davies found the woman she was lying on her back close up to the flight of steps leading into the yard.  the throat was cut open in a fearful manner - so deep, in fact, that the murderer, evidently thinking he had severed the head from the body, tied a handkerchief so as to keep it on.  the fiendish work was completed by the murderer tying a portion of the entrails around the victims neck.  there was no blood on the clothes.hanbury street is a long street, which runs from bakers row to commercial street.  it consists partly of shops and partly of private houses.  in the house in question, in the front room on the ground floor, mr. harderman carries on the business of a seller of cats meat.  at the back of the premises are those of mr. richardson, who is a packing-case maker.  the other occupants of the house are lodgers.  one of the lodgers, robert thompson, who is a carman, went out of the house at 3.30 in the morning, but heard no noise.  two girls, who also live in the house, were talking in the passage until 12.30 with young men, and it is believed that they were the last occupants of the house to retire.it seems thatthe crime was committedsoon after 5.  at that hour the woman and the man who in all probability was her murderer were seen drinking together in the ten bells, brick lane.  but though the murder was committed at this late hour, the murderer, as in the other case, silently and stealthily managed to make his escape.on the wall near where the body was found there was, according to one reporter, discovered written in chalk: five; 15 more and then i give myself up.  davies, the lodger who discovered the body, immediately communicated with the police at commercial-street station and inspector chandler and several constables arrived on the scene in a short time when they found the woman in the condition described.  an excited crowd gathered in front of mrs. richardsons house.  several persons who were lodging in the house, and who were seen in the vicinity when the body was found, were taken to the station and closely examined, especially the woman last with the deceased.  inquiries led to the discovery that the woman was known by several names.  her real name was annie chapman, but she had latterly passed as annie silvy, and rejoiced in the nickname of dark annie.  her age was about 45.  she was 5 feet high, had a fair face, brown, wavy hair, blue eyes and, like mary ann nicholls,had two teeth missingone peculiarity of her features was a large, flat kind of nose.mrs. fiddymont, wife of the proprietor of the prince albert public house, better known as the clean house, at the corner of brushfield and stewart streets, half a mile from the scene of the murder, told the police that at 7 oclock saturday morning she was standing at the bar talking with another woman in the first compartment.  there suddenly came into the middle compartment a man whose rough appearance frightened her.  he had a brown stiff dark hat and no waistcoat.  he came in with his hat pulled down over his eyes and with his face partly concealed, and asked for half a pint of ale.  she drew the ale and meanwhile looked at him.  as soon as he saw the woman in the other compartment watching him he turned his back and got the partition between them.  there were blood spots on the back of his right hand.  his shirt was torn.  as soon as he had drank the ale, which he sawllowed at a gulp, he went out.  he wore a light blue check shirt, which was in rags.  there was a narrow streak of blood under his right ear, parallel with the edge of his shirt.the man was rather thin, about 5 feet 8 inches high, and apparently between 40 and 50 years of age.  he had a shabby genteel look, pepper and salt trousers, which fitted him badly, and dark coat.  the man walked, holding his coat together at the top.  he had a nervous and frightened way about him.  he wore a ginger-colored moustache and had short sandy hair.this man is probably the fiend whom the police seek, but who is still at large and unknown.on sunday, sept. 23, the body of a woman, an unfortunate, was found at gateshead, near new castle-on-the-tyne.  although gateshead is so far from london the similarity of this crime in all respects to the other members had induced the belief among many thatthe same unknown fiendperformed it.  if this is so, this murder is the fifth in the history of the whitechapel horrors.  whether or not it be true that the whitechapel brute reacted so far from the scene of his other crimes as gateshead, it is certainly worth attention, from the fact that the mutilation of his victim is identical with the cutting and slashing found upon the bodies of the others.  the throat was cut with a long, clean sweep of some exceedingly sharp weapon.  the clothing was thrown up over the victims head and the same organ was found to have been removed as before.and now comes the latest chapter of these mysterious murders with the slaying of two more women in a single night.  the victims of sunday night were of the unfortunate class who ply their trade in the dingy alleys and dimly lighted streets of the east end.  the first of these two murders was committed on berner street, whitechapel, which is a thoroughfare of the dissolute and depraved.  next to the socialist club is a stable-yard, guarded at the street line by gates of solid wood, left open during the night for members of the club and people living in the adjoining tenements.  sunday morning, about 1 oclock, the steward of the socialist club went out on an errand, leaving the wooden gates open.  when he returned, a few minutes later, he found the gates neatly closed and a woman with her throat cut from ear to ear and quite dead, jammed between them.there was no mutilation of the body as in the previous whitechapel crimes.  it was a brutal murder committed in a populous thoroughfare patrolled by the police.  the head was almost severed.  the body was identified by a woman as that of hippy lip annie, a dissolute character familiar in the neighborhood.  saturday night she was seen carousing in the public houses in the company of several men.  when and by whom she was murdered is a mystery, but all the circumstances go to show that it was certainly the work of a person known to the police and the newspapers as the whitechapel murderer.  it is known that the spot where the body was found was passed by a policeman only a few moments before the body was discovered.  as the throat was cut and the face mutilated as in the other instances, it is reasonable to suppose that the only reason the other mutilations of the body were not found is because the murderer was frightened away before he had completed his task.in the case of the second murder of last sunday, or the seventh of the fiends victims, the place selected for the crime, the nature of the throat wound that caused instantaneous death, and the dreadful mutilations of the body, all go to show the work of the same hand that committed the four previous atrocious murders that are shrouded in mystery and have made the whole world shudder.  this murder was committed quite outside the balliwick of the metropolitan police and in the territory patrolled by the city of london police, an entirely distinct organization of about a thousand men.these circumstances make the murder committed this morning the most daring of the whitechapel series, and strengthens the general impression that they are the work of a homicidal maniac.no sane man would have chosen such a place for such a crime.  but if the murderer is a maniac he is wonderfully shrewd and clever, and one skilled in the use of the knife and familiar with the devices of the dissecting table.  every stroke of his knife cuts into a vital part.  in short, he is a skilled anatomist.the body was found at 1.45 a.m. in the southwest corner of mitre square, a spot which watkins, the watchman, had passed on his beat a quarter of an hour before, which shows with what despatch the woman-killer must have worked.  the body was lying on its back on the footway with its head towards the wall and the feet towards the carriage way.  the head was inclined on the left side and both arms were extended outward.  the left leg was straight out and the right leg bent away from the body.the body was warm and the blood had not congealed, proving that the murderer must have gone just as the constable was approaching.  watkins sent for doctors, and while waiting roused up policeman pearce, and the two taking courage together threw the light of their lamps on the corpse, which watkins had not dared to do.  it is not to be wondered at that the policeman has been too ill all day to answer questions.the womans throat was cut from ear to ear and half the way round the head.  her clothes had been raised up to the chest, and the body had been completely cut open from the pelvis to the chest.  the flaps of flesh were turned back, revealing the intestines.  in addition, a portion of the right ear was cut off and the nose was slashed half-way through.  the face was also slashed and cut in a most brutal fashion, and a portion of the intestines was placed in the gash around the neck.several doctors arrived and examined the body.  they found a prodigious quantity of blood, which had flowed chiefly from the throat, but the murderer had so carefully avoided it that not a single footmark could be traced.  the body was removed to the mortuary, where a careful post-mortem examination took place.such is the story of murder and mystery that now not only holds the attention of all england, but the entire civilized world.the lord mayor of london has offered a reward of £500 for the arrest of the perpetrator of the whitechapel murders.  dr. henry forbes winslow, sir risdon bennett and other medical experts are more than ever convinced that the murderer is a homicidal lunatic.still another.the mutilated corpse of a woman found in a london vault.london, oct. 2.-the corpse of a woman was today found in a vault on the site of the projected opera house on the thames embankment, near the houses of parliament.the head and arm had been severed from the body, and the arm is missing.  the body was in an advanced state of decomposition.  the murder must have been committed weeks ago."

revolting than the seven which preceded it.  accurate circumstances of the affair are difficult to discover.  the police are as usual placing every obstacle in the way of the investigation of reporters, but all reports go to prove this a murder far surpassing in fiendish atrocity all the terrible crimes with which the east end of london has been familiarized within the past six months.a woman, 26 years old, by name mary jane kelly, has lived for four months in the front room on the second floor of a house, up an alley known as cartin's court.this poor woman was in service a short time ago, but since she came to reside in the court she had been recognized by neighbors as a person who like so many unfortunate members of her sex in the eastern end of the town, has managed to pass a wretched existence by the practice of immorality under the most degrading conditions.  cartin's court faces a small square with a narrow entrance, and is surrounded by squalid lodging-houses with rooms to let to women of this unfortunate class.the kelly woman is described as tall, and not bad looking, dark complexioned, and generally wearing an old black velvet jacket.  she was wearing this jacket this morning when about 8.15 she went down the court, jug in hand, and returned shortly afterwards with milk.  after breakfast she was next seen about 10 o'clock, when she went to a neighboring beer house, and stayed there drinking for half an hour.  this was the last seen of her alive.the woman was behind in rent and had been told by the landlord that she would be put out if she did not pay today.  she went on the streets last night to earn money to pay the rent, and it seems to be clearly established that she returned to her room with a man whopassed the night with herno one has been found who saw the man go in, but some neighbors heard him talking to the kelly woman in her room, and heard her singing as though she were drunk.at 11 o'clock this morning a man named bowyer, agent for the landlord, went ot miss kelly's room to collect the rent.  when he knocked at the door he received no answer.  removing the curtain drawn across the window of the room and looking through the broken window pane, mr. bowyer saw the woman lying on the bed, on her back, stark naked, while marks of blood were visible all over the place.  he tried the handle of the door and found it locked, while the key had been removed from the lock.  without going into the room mr. bowyer called the police, who promptly proceeded to conceal all the facts in the case.in less than two hours the doctors had the body in the morgue and were probing it precisely as they did the mitre square victim.  they refused to give any details of the examination, but dr. gove, one of the physicians present, admitted that he had passed much of his life in dissecting rooms, but never saw such a horrible spectacle as the murdered woman. the man who was called in to identify the body gives the following descriptions, which seems to be reliable:the head was nearly severed from the shoulders and the face lacerated almost beyond recognition: the breasts both cut off and placed on the table: the heart and liver were between the woman's legs, the uterus was missing, and there seemed to be at least 40 cuts on the body, and big pieces of flesh literally stripped off and strewn on the floor.it is simply too hideous to describe.  there were no indications in this case of the hand skilled in the use of a knife.  the body is literally hacked to pieces, but there is no doubt at all but that it is the work of the person who has become known throughout the world as thewhitechapel murderer.the mystery in this case is as deep as in the preceding crimes.  the fiend got away without leaving the slightest clew.  he chose his time well.  at the moment when mr. bowyer discovered the murdered body that gorgeous annual nuisance which goes by the name of the lord mayor's show, blocking the traffic of the great city for hours, was organizing near mansion house, scarcely a mile away.  nearly 3,000,000 people were packed in the streets between mansion house and trafalgar square, with nearly every policeman in the city braced as a barricade along the curb to keep them in order.  the rigid police patrol maintained in whitechapel since the last double murder in october was removed for one day, and in that one day the assassin struck down another victim.it is scarcely necessary to say much about mary kelly.  she was a married woman who fell into dissolute ways, and was deserted by her husband.  she had a boy 11 years old, who was begging in the streets while the mother was murdered.  the woman had as a paramour a man who sells oranges in the streets, and on whom, as he could not be found, suspicion at once reverted.  but he turned up all right tonight, and fainted when he was shown the murdered woman's body.like the sands that slowly filter through an hour glass when reversed, the great throng on the streets who had been observing the new lord mayor found their way into whitechapel.  when the news of the murder spread about every heard was filled with horror.  when was this to end?  how long would this fiend in human form carve people to pieces under the noses of the police and mock their feeble efforts to catch him?the london police are not allowed to club a crowd into submission as are american police, unless an absolute riot is imminent, but the indignation and excitement was great in whitechapel today.  it was necessary for them to use harsh measures.  profiting by former blunders the police called a photographer to take a picture of the room before the body was removed from it.  this gives rise to a report that bloodyhandwriting was on the wall.though three or four people who were allowed to enter the room say they did not observe it, but possibly they were too excited to notice details.a young girl who knew the murdered woman well, says that about 10 last night she met her, and that she had no money.  she said she could not get any.  she would never go out any more, but would do away with herself.  soon after they parted, and the man, who is described as respectably dressed, came up and spoke to the murdered woman and offered her money.  the man then accompanied the woman to her lodgings.the little boy was removed from the room and taken to a neighbor's house.  the boy has been found and corroborates this, but says he cannot remember the man's face.another curious circumstance is worth mentioning.  the murder was not made known until 12 o'clock.  mrs. paumier, who seems to be a credible person, sells walnuts in sandys row, near the scene of the murder.  she states that at 11 o'clock today a respectably dressed man carrying a black bag came up to her and began talking about the murder.  he wanted to know everything about it. he did not buy any walnuts, and, after standing a few minutes, went away.  mrs. paumier describes him as about 30 years old, 5 feet six inches in height.  he wore a checked pair of trousers and a black coat.several girls in the neighborhood say the same man accosted them, and they chafled him.  when they asked him what he had in the black bag he said: ""something that ladies don't like.""  this is all that is known of him.if the police have further information they carefully conceal it, but there is no reason to believe that they have.where crime stalks.whitechapel and its chapter of horrorsnew york, nov. 9.-the world tomorrow will publish the following:london, oct. 30.-the word ""whitechapel"" has passed as a verb into the vocabulary of the criminal classes.  no less than a dozen women of the streets have complained of an assailant in the police courts this week that he had threatened to ""whitechapel"" them.  within a few days the word has assumed a horrible significance.the whitechapel murders have startled the whole world.  an obscure locality in a great metropolis, the border line between povertyville and the affluent splendor of the west end, is forced into a lurid glare of publicity.  mysterious murders are the topic of the day.  politics and everything else that newspapers usually print, and the public reads about, are wiped out in a smudge of blood.next to ""who is the murderer?"" people are asking, ""what and where is whitechapel?""  what is usually called the whitechapel district is about equivalent in territory to the east side of new york city from houston street to frankfort street, bounded on the west by the bowery and chatham street.  there are worse slums in london than whitechapel, just as there are worse slums in new york than are to be found in the territory i have indicated.  through this populous region the whitechapel road runs obliquely much as broadway runs through new york city.  this thoroughfare is the bowery of london, but twice as big, thrice as wicked, and four times the number of people pushing and crowding through it after nightfall.the dissolute and vicious of all climes congregate there: black ""lascar"" sailors from india crazed with rum; gay girls from paris, who had to leave that city or go to prison for purification; men and women who have ""done their term"" in the prisons; others who have escaped and never stir out fo (sic) the daylight; thieves and thugs, housebreakers and harlots - there they all are.the sky is aglow with the glare of splendid gin palaces, cheap theatres and the smoking naptha lamps of thousands of street vendors.  you may see the reflection of it for miles, but they are not all wicked people that you see in whitechapel at night.  it is the shopping street of the respectable laborer and his wife.it is one of the great trade arteries of the metropolis, one of the unique thoroughfares in the world.  whitechapel is cleaner than the territory i have referred to on the east side of new york.  it is not nearly so dilapidated as the communists' quarter of paris, but you will find more squalid, ragged children there, more half-dressed wretched looking men and women than you can scrape up in new york and paris put together.it is the loose women of whitechapel that make it one of the strangest and saddest spectacles in christendom.  hundreds upon hundreds of these forlorn creatures tramp the streetsfrom dark till dawn.they have no home.  it is seldom that they even sleep two nights under the same roof.  these unfortunates ply their vocation in the open streets, in the hallways of lodging-houses and in the sheltered ""squares,"" where they can gain privacy.  in bitterest weather they roam houseless, creeping in stairways to sleep, huddling in untenanted cellars, packed close to one another for warmth.until these murders began no policeman disturbed them.  so long as they did not quarrel they were allowed to forget their misery in slumber.  all that is changed now.  the policemen are ordered to rout the unfortunate creatures out and they tramp about all night and all next day till they can get fourpence to hire a bed.  while looking up the murders for the world i was asked for a penny by one girl not 17 years old, who declared she had not been able to find a place to sleep undisturbed, for 48 hours, and she looked it.  they live and breathe in a putrid atmosphere of pitiable misery and unspeakable vice.here is what a young woman who is doing missionary work among the people says: ""the terrible difficulty we have to encounter is that of trying to find them work.  we had last year a very touching case of a woman who seemed sincerely  desirous of mending her ways, but who was over the age at which they are usually admitted to homes.  after a great deal of difficulty we found an opening for her, and she went to the home, but some of these places, i am afraid, are managed too rigorously, and the matrons are sometimes wanting in sympathy with the inmates, who find it extremely difficult to submit to the discipline.  it was the case with this woman; she found the discipline of this place more than she could endure, and she left; but she came to us again and still seemed sick and weary of the wretched life she led.  if she could find something to do she really would try, but of the - home - she seemed to have a positive horror.  we could find her no work, and she tried charing and washing, and i believe did her earnest best to maintain herself that way.  but it was gradual starvation.  often we found she was whole days without food, and those she lived with say that only at the last extremity did she allow herself to be drawn again to her old course.  i'm afraid, however, she drifted back but still she would come to our meetings, and would borrow from our library books that you would never imagine she would care to read.  she came to a meeting one tuesday night and scarcely able to stand, and on thursday she died.""the woman who looks after these mission rooms,"" continued the speaker, ""was another from the same class, and she used to be an associate of the poor creatures murdered in berners street.  she saw her only last thursday and she - that is, the murdered woman - said then that she felt she was coming to some bad end.""the excitement and fear of whitechapel people since the two last murders i will not attempt to describe.  they know well the opportunities that the criminal has for keeping from the clutches of the police, and that if he is captured at all it will probably be in the act ofbutchering another victim.which of them will it be?  until the bodies were identified the city mortuary was surrounded all day by people, attracted there by some horrible fascination, hoping to get a look at the mutilated bodies within.  it was wise of the police to make this number as small as possible.  no one who saw those victims will ever forget them.the first of the six whitechapel murders dates back to april 3, when emma elizabeth smith was found dead in a yard near osborne street with a large hole in her abdomen, made by a sharp iron stake or some similar instrument.  there was nothing of the horrifying mutilation of the body which has made the five subsequent murders world-famous in the annals of crime.  evil deeds are common enough in the slums of london, and this was a woman of the street, killed, it was presumed, by a jealous lover or an angry husband.  the public read that the ""affair was in the hands of the police,"" and promptly forgot it.it is not believed that this murder had any connection with the subsequent horrors committed by the unknown spoken of as the ""maniac murderer.""  polly nicols, another vagrant of the streets, was the first victim to the shocking brutality of this fiend.  at 3.45 on the morning of aug. 31 policeman john o'neil was walking through bucks row, whitechapel, when he saw what he thought was a woman asleep on the pavement.  he prodded her with his foot and said, ""come, old girl, you can't sleep here.""the woman never moved, and he stooped down to turn her over to get a look at her face; his hands were bathed in warm blood.  he had passed the same spot not 15 minutes before, and a most atrocious murder had been committed while he had been gone.  if there had been a cry for help or a scuffle for life he could scarcely have helped hearing the whole length of his beat.  three men working in a slaughterhouse near by never heard a sound.the woman's head was nearly severed back to the vertebra, which was also slightly injured.  one gash under the left ear reached nearly to the center of her throat; another cut starting from the right ear, was almost as long.  the woman's skirts were torn from her body and her abdomen ripped open so that the bowels protruded.  one cut, extending from the womb to the breast bone, was such as only a strong man skilled in the use of a knife could have made.  the victim's front teeth were knocked out and her face much bruised, while her hands gave evidence that she hadstruggled desperately for life.when policeman o'neil was questioned closely he recollected that the body was lying on its back, with outstretched hands, as though it had been placed where it was found.  there are three or four low houses close by, and the theory was suggested that the woman was murdered in one of them and then carried into the street.such a crime could scarcely be carried out without leaving traces of blood, and though the houses were carefully searched nothing of the kind was found.the keeper of a lodging-house near by remembered polly coming to him a few hours before she was murdered to get a bed.  she had been drinking, but was not drunk.  she had not the fourpence to pay for a bed, and he would not let her have it.  the poor women went into the street to earn her ""doss"" as she had done scores of times before.  no one has been found who saw her alive after that.a gateman was on duty all night at the crossing of the great eastern railway, scarcely 60 yards from where her body was found, but he heard no screams.very early on the morning of aug. 7, john reeves, living at 37 george hayward buildings, whitechapel, was coming down stairs to go to work.  the george hayward buildings are divided into tenements of three and four rooms each all occupied by working people.  on the first floor landing reeves found the body of a woman in a pool of blood.  she had been stabbed in 39 places with a sharp pointed instrument, probably a bayonet.  the walls of the houses are thin, and ordinary conversation on the lower landing can easily be heard in the rooms up stairs.  yet no one in the house, not even four people sleeping 12 feet away from where the body was soaking in blood, head any unusual noise that night.  elizabeth mahony, who lived in the house, did not get home until 2 o'clock in the morning and the body was not there then.  the murdered woman was identified as martha tabram.  another outcast was buried and forgotten.in less than a week there was another murder, evidently by the same hand, only the fiendish brutality to the victim was worse.  this time, too, it was a prostitute.  annie chapman was once the wife of a well-to-do veterinary surgeon living at windsor.  drink and immorality separated her from her husband, who allowed her 10 shillings a week to live on.  he died, the allowance ceased and the poor woman joined the innumerablearmy of street walkers.no. 29 hanbury street, spitalfields, is a tenement house, let out to many families, most of whom keep lodgers.  in this house, os (sic) in most houses of its class, there is no lock to the front door.  anybody can pass into the hall from the street.  for protection the tenants lock the doors opening into the landings.  there is a large yard in the rear of these tenement houses, and it is a common custom for women of the street to take men there for privacy.  beyond doubt this was the case with annie chapman.  like the woman nicols, she had not money to pay for her bed.  she said to the lodging-house keeper:""save a bed for me: i shan't be long.""john davies, a carman, lives at 29 hanbury street.  he was not well the night of the murder and woke at 3 a.m.  at 5 or shortly after he went down stairs to the back yard.  there was nobody there then.  at about 5.40 he went to the yard again.  when he reached the lower hall he noticed that the back door was closed and the front door was wide open.  when he opened the back door he saw annie chapman's bleeding body at the foot of the steps.  davies had been lying awake in bed, and had heard no scream or cry for help.  he did hear footsteps in the hallway, but that was nothing unusual, for some people in the house had to go to work at 6 o'clock.the murder had been committed inside of 40 minutes, and not one of the 500 people within sound of a woman's voice had heard even a groan.  made bold by the failure of the police to catch him, or even get on his track, the murderercarved this victimto his hearts' content.  the physician who examined the body asked to be spared relating the circumstances to the coroner's jury.mrs. burridge, a shopkeeper in black friar road, died in a fit while reading an account of the horror in a newspaper.  though circumstances show that the murderer had less than 40 minutes at his disposal there was no sign of haste about his work.  he cut up his victim as deliberately and skillfully as a surgeon operates on a cadaver at the dissecting table.  he killed her as he did the other women by almost cutting her head from her shoulders, and then proceeded to disembowel her, attaching a portion of the intestines to her neck.  the uterus he cut out and carried away.the panic created by this piece of butchery and the increased vigilance of the police seemed to have frightened the murderer off, but the morning of sept. 30 he sallied forth again.  at 1 o'clock he met elizabeth stride on berner street and cut her throat.  the fact that the body was not otherwise mutilated made it possible that it was not the work of the same assassin.  but the doctors who have examined the wounds in the throat believe that it is.here is a physician's description of the wound: there was a clean-cut incision on the neck.  it was six inches in length and commenced 2 ½ inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, three-quarters of an inch over an undivided muscle, and then, becoming deeper, dividing the sheath.  the cut was very clean and deviated a little downward.  the artery and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through.  the cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial and sailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw.  the deep vessels on that side were uninjured.from this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left carotid artery.berner street is a badly-lighted thoroughfare, inhabited by tolerably respectable people.  the workmen's international educational club has a building there.  there is a stable in the rear of it, shut off from the street by two stout wooden gates.  there is a small door in one gate fastened with a latch.the probability is that the murderer got the woman just inside the door, cut her throat, and was frightened by noise made by people moving about in the club-room.  there were any number of people astir in the neighborhood when elizabeth stride's life was taken, but no one heard a sound.  the steward of the club-rooms found the body just inside the wooden gate when he went there after 1 o'clock sunday morning.  the body was still warm and the blood was trickling under the gate, down the pavement to the gutter.  the steward called some of the members in the club who were simplystaggered by the sight.one man said that he had closed the gate himself when he passed through the yard 20 minutes previous.  the woman was identified.  her life story is a sad one, but there are thousands in london and in new york, too, for that manner.meanwhile, to follow the murderer.  while the police were carrying the body of elizabeth stride to the dead house, he was knifing another woman 10 minutes' walk from the spot.  officer watkins, who covered that beat that sunday night, is considered one of the most reliable men on the force.  he talks like a shrewd, careful fellow.  at 1.30 sunday morning he walked through mitre square.  two street lamps were burning there and three windows in a large warehouse were ablaze with light.  the policeman could see the watchman of the warehouse reading within.  all was quiet.  exactly 15 minutes later the policeman passed that way again.  his feet slipped in the blood of another murdered woman.  the policeman could have heard a woman's shriek from one end of his beat to the other, but he did not hear one that night.  not a sound disturbed the watchman in the warehouse.  just inside the railings, not 20 feet from the dead body, an ex-policeman lived with his family,and the windows of their bedrooms faced the square.  no cry for help disturbed their slumber.  in this case again the murderer had time to mutilate his victim unmolested.  her throat was cut first, of course, then the assassin's knife was thrust into the upper part of the abdomen and drawn completely down, ripping open the stomach and exposing the intestines.  in addition there was another deep cut across the abdomen, and the left kidney have been carefully taken out.  it was the work, so a competent physician thinks, of a man skilled in anatomy, sure in his stroke with the knife, and steady of nerve.  this kidney was taken away by the murderer, a part of the uterus with ligament attached was taken away also, the face was horribly disfigured.  a part of the right ear had been taken off, and a deep gash extended across the right cheek, almost to the nose or rather the place where the nose ought to have been, for that was cut off too.  this woman was identified as catharine eddowes, a street hawker, living with a man named kelly.  if the day's business was bad, as was often the case, she tried to make a little moneyin the slums at night.on oct. 2 another mutilated body of a woman was discovered, and this crime is attributed by some to the whitechapel murderer.  it was found in an open vault, on the site of the projected grand opera house, within a stone's throw of the grand and metropole hotels, and within sight of police headquarters at scotland yard.  the body was in an advanced state of decomposition, and had been subjected to mutilation similar in fiendish ingenuity to those inflicted on the whitechapel victims.  the head and arms had been separated from the body, the abdomen cut vertically and the viscera exposed.  the monster evidently had more time and was able to perform his terrible task with greater leisure.  he had wrapped up the remains and corded them.  one arm was missing.  a month before a woman's arm had been found floating in the thames at pimlico, and this is believed to be the missing member.the locality is one of the busiest and wealthiest parts of london, and is thronged with thousands of people, but at night is somewhat deserted, and the thames embankment, with its brilliant electric lights and heavy shadows, is considered one of the most dangerous spots of all london after 10 p.m.sir charles warren, forced to say something in response to the frantic appeals for prompt and effective action made to him, said:""statistics show that london, in comparison to its population is the safest city in the world to live in.""it is due to the police to say that their failure to catch the criminal has not been wholly due to inactivity.  this is especially true of the ""city"" force.  each organization is working independently of the other, according to its own methods.  the investigation of the numerous slaughter houses in the district has been most thorough.  every one in the east end and some others have practically been turned inside out.  the proprietors and managers have in most cases heartily co-operated with the police.  every policeman has been personally ""pumped.""  each man has been called upon to give an account of himself and his whereabouts, not only on saturday night, sept. 29, but during the entire period over which the series of crimes extends.  every suspicious circumstance is made a note of, and no one to whom the slightest suspicion attaches is lost sight of until the suspicion is completely allayed.  nor has the man's own word been accepted as conclusive.  each man has been asked if he knows of any one who has not been regular at his work or has played tricks on the timekeeper, for the time book in each establishment plays an important part of the investigation.  more than all this, in some cases all men who can write have been called upon to make a statement in writing and sign their names so that any possible question of handwriting may be more easily compared.the same thoroughness has characterized what has been done in the lodging-houses.  deputies were required to make a showing of their regular lodgers, to point out their habits, their peculiarities and their associates, and to furnish descriptions of all causal visitors who hadattracted special attention.frequenters of lodging-houses have been interviewed by hundreds, and detectives have been scattered all over the district disguised as men ""down on their luck.""  in the hope of the picking up some information; but the police have pretty well made up their minds that the man they want is not to be found through the lodging-house channel.the fact that so many of the victims were themselves frequenters of these caravansaries has quickened their instincts and aroused the spirit of the class, and it would be almost impossible for a murderer to be among them without some one giving him away.the attention that has been paid to the hospitals has been quite as close, but the police have not always found the hospital authorities too eager to assist them.  the ethics of medical etiquette appear to stand in the way of full and free investigation among medical students, at least, for they are slow to tell what they know or suspect when it may affect one of their number.  one police inspector said that he supposed there was over a hundred men who were being individually shadowed in his district alone, and if the same system is in vogue all over the east end, the number of detectives on the job must be something enormous.  there is not a vacant building in the east end that has not been thoroughly searched, lest it might afford a hiding place for the murderer, and in at least tow instances the drain pipes have been taken up for a long distance where suspicious matter was thought to have been deposited.every vessel that has left the harbor since the commission of the last crime has been thoroughly overhauled, the work houses have been visited for the examination of all new inmates, and even the prison authorities have been enlisted in the cause for the sake of keeping a close eye on prisoners who may have been glad to get put away for a time for trivial offences.  it is estimated, roughly speaking, that there are at least 500 men engaged in these investigations who are not police officers, but who are directly instructed by the police officials.  the arrests so far are legion.well, at this writing no one is under arrest; all the men locked up on suspicion and on delirium tremens confessions have been discharged.  a man from new york was among the number.  he came into the world office afterward and wanted it explained that he was ""on a lark.""  well, he had his fun, and from the police court evidence he deserved all the unsavory publicity he got.  but so far it has all amounted to nothing.  whether it will do so before this letter reaches the world looks very doubtful now.  baffled.london detectives at their wits' end.whitechapel fiend still at largecharacteristics that mark his conduct.no motive hit upon as yet.save that his victim sang ""sweet violets,""after which no further sound was heard.pardon offered any accomplice turning state's evidence.london, nov. 10.-the excitement here this morning over the lengthening series of whitechapel atrocities is more intense than ever.  the papers are having enormous sales, though they contain little besides speculation and rumors.  beyond the broad facts of this ninth atrocity, the police are endeavoring to keep everything secret.the one question in everybody's mind is, can the murderer of mary jane mccarthy or kelly be found?this is the problem before the london police, and the impression prevails that it will be answered negatively.  but if so public indignation is likely to culminate in an overturning of the present police authorities.yet the whitechapel monster left more tracks behind him in this than in any other previous butchery.  he was seen by several persons.as he was entering the small court which led to the dirty room where the crime was committed, both the man and mary jane stopped and laughed at a large poster which offers £100 reward for the whitechapel murderer.  a number of people who live in a lodging-house across the way noted the incident, and give this description of the man: about 30 years old, 5 feet 6 inches tall, wore speckled trousers and a black coat and respectable in appearance.a mrs. paumier, who sells walnuts in sandys row, gives a similar description of a man who talked with her about the murder at 11 o'clock yesterday.  he bought no walnuts, but lingered around the locality for some time.  in his left hand he carried a black bag.  he accosted several girls in the neighborhood, and when asked by them what he carried in the bag, replied in a sarcastic tone:""something the ladies don't like.""""fair emma,"" as she was known to the denizens of commercial street, was between 26 and 30 years of age.  her small boy has recently been living with some friendly neighbors.  thursday night, soon after midnight, she came into dorset street, accompanied by a man.  they turned out of the street into miller's court.  once in the woman's room, persons in the house heard her singing ""sweet violets"" in a drunken voice.  no sound was detected from the room thereafter until the horribly mutilated body was discovered yesterday by the landlord, who called to collect his rent.yet here are definite facts for the police to work upon.  it is sir charles warren's opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency or inefficiency of himself and his subordinates.the bloodhounds put upon the murderer's track proved a failure.  the police are baffled and helpless as before.  the keenest detectives int eh force, who have been on the watch since the last murder, are unable to find a clew or even form a theory.as on previous occasions, in the absence of any indications, a drag-net has been thrown over the metropolis, and all the men who can be spared are searching every railway station, public house, evil resort and hole and corner, not only in the east end, but throughout the city.there is no doubt that this and the eight other butcheries which preceded it were perpetrated by one and the same man, who decoys or suffers himself to appear to be decoyed into a safe place; that the murder is instantaneous, no warning being given the victim, nor chance to cry for help, no time to struggle for life; thatthe mutilation of the remainsis accomplished at such leisure as the murderer may have, and it is noted that the ingenuity of his fiendish devices is in proportion to the time in each case which he probably had at his disposal; that he leaves no mark behind except upon the bodies of his victims; that even the money and jewelry have been untouched, and that he enters and leaves a house without making a noise or attracting the slightest attention, as in the last case, when people were up or awake all night in the building and heard nothing remarkable.he waits, watches his chances, secures his prey, seizes the opportunity, applies the knife probably at the instant when the unresisting victim is most off her guard, finishes the awful work and vanishes into the void of london.the only defence made by sir chas. warren of the police for their failure to discover the assassin is that both parties conspire, as it were, to prevent detection by shrouding their movements in darkness and secrecy.the people of london are exasperated beyond measure at the repetition of these atrocities.  demands for the offer of a large reward are again made upon home secretary matthews.the panic in whitechapel and spitalfields is revived.  the outcasts who formerly thronged the streets cower in their lodgings in a state of abject terror.  their traffic has been stopped as if a pestilence were abroad.not a woman could be seen on the streets last night in the infected quarters.  the police have again been doubled.  every doubtful house is under espionage, and every suspicious stranger is closely watched.general warren, chief of the metropolitan police, has issued a proclamation offering a free pardon to any accomplice the whitechapel murderer may have, provided he will give information which will lead to the murderer's apprehension.  it is learned that the woman whose mutilated body was found in the dorset street house yesterday was a native of limerick, ire.  she migrated to wales, where she married a collier, who was subsequently killed by an explosion.  after that she drifted to london."
131,index/boston_daily_globe_18881210.txt,boston_daily_globe,1888-12-10,"boston daily globemonday, 10 december 1888""slumming"" scenes of vice, poverty, and crime.witnessed at night by a lady newspaper correspondent. visiting the scenes of the late whitechapel tragedies. london., dec 1. - ""slumming."" curious term, no doubt to you on the other side of the water, but one which london papers have universally adopted as exactly ""fitting the case."" for the past two years, and especially during the cold months of winter, the lady members of many of our aristocratic families of park lane and belgravia have indulged in the craze of ""slumming."" using their persuasive eloquence upon the male members of their families to accompany them, they have courageously visited, during the day, many of the poorest localities and slums of our great metropolis, seeing with their own eyes the abject poverty of their fellow-citizens and relieving the wants of the poor personally and to such an extent that their visits have indeed been ""angel's visits,"" undoubtedly saving many a poor wretch from starvation and perhaps death. at one tenement a few loaves of bread for a starving family, at another an order for a hundredweight of coal, tea, sugar, flour, or whatever they thought would best serve the necessities of the case, these kind and humane ladies have been welcome visitors indeed.none, however, have dared to enter those terrible dens of infamy and crime so common in the district, now so well known throughout england, and i may say the civilized world - whitechapel - up to the last few weeks, when that enterprising paper published by sir william christopher leng, the sheffield telegraph, commissioned its lady correspondent to make a tour at night of the famous locality, accompanied by a detective, and write for its columns her impressions and ocular demonstration of the state of affairs existing there.the lady, who is well known and who ranks high in the estimation of her brother and sister scribblers, accompanied by a detective as equally well known, has made the tour, and the result of her observations and graphic description of the scenes she witnessed in her visit have been printed. her pictures of vice, misery, poverty and crime are so vivid and lifelike that, combined with the pluck she has shown in her hazardous undertakings, she has earned the highest praise and esteem of her fellow laborers. i send you her story, as she tells it in her own words, accompanied with a map of the whitechapel district, so that your readers can see at a glance the streets and spots where the seven terrible tragedies have taken place.slumming  whitechapel.sights and scenes witnessed during a tour by night.perhaps there is no locality in the united kingdom which at the present time is so notorious as whitechapel. the horrible tragedies so recently enacted there in such rapid succession have sent a thrill of indignant fear throughout england, while in the neighborhood itself the panic still lasts, and will do so as long as the bloodthirsty monster remains unknown and uncaptured.after the dreadful crimes so placidly perpetrated in mitre square and berners [sic] street, i conceived an ardent desire to visit and see for myself the region of a civilized city that seems to be given up to horrors unmentionable.the thing that puzzled me was how to go. night is the best time, but it is hardly the place where a stranger would care to go to alone, and in a great measure unprotected.i mentioned the difficulty to a friend of mine, inspector r--- of the city police.""it is not a nice neighborhood,"" he said thoughtfully, ""and it is of no use going there unless you know your way about, or else you stand a tidy chance of getting knocked on your head, or returning minus your watch and chain.""i looked rather glum, and he went on to remark ""that he would have been pleased to accompany me only he was leaving town the next day on particular business.""""where do you want to go?"" he asked.""well,"" i replied, ""i want to go to mitre square, buck's row, berners street, and hanbury street and just see for myself what class of people really do live there.""""i can manage that for you,"" he said. ""one of our men, mr. b----, is thoroughly efficient and highly respectable and intelligent officer, and he can go round with you.""i thanked the worthy inspector, who introduced me to mr. b----, a tall, muscular and rather handsome man, and an arrangement was made there and then that i should meet the officer on the next night by the law courts.the next evening we met at the appointed place, my escort looking very big and stalwart in his civilian dress, and i, clad in the darkest and least conspicuous of clothes.it was a lovely night, clear and cold, the blue heavens all aglow with myriads of stars. the strand was busy as only the strand can be.we hailed a 'bus, and soon we left the glare and bustle of the strand and fleet street far behind. at leadenhall street we got down and just at the end of that street and whitechapel road is a narrow street which leads into mitre square.although mitre square is respectable, it affords facilities for crime. at night it is comparatively deserted, and, moreover, is badly lit, the corners being completely enveloped in gloom, and another thing is that there are few thoroughfares leading in and out of the square.the next place we visited was berners street, and to get there we had to cross whitechapel road and go down commercial street [sic]. the bustle and noise was most grateful after the fearful hush of mitre square: there were quantities of men and women, but what men and women were they? as we got near to berners street, mr. b---- asked me ""if i felt frightened?"" i laughed and replied in the negative, and then he showed me with a certain amount of satisfaction that he was provided with his whistle anda thick, heavy walking stick.in another few minutes we were in what my companion tersely described as a beastly locality. a long, ill-paved, narrow, badly-lit street. the lamps are few and far between, and show a flickering, sickly, yellow light.after the glare of whitechapel road, the darkness seems trebly bad. the houses are small and squalid, and teeming with life. late as it is, one must walk carefully for fear of falling over half-naked infants, who crawl about the broken pavements.soon we leave the groups of horrible children behind and the thoroughfare looks deserted, and is so quiet that our footsteps ring out startlingly distinct on the still night air.we cross over, and mr. b---- points out a door apparently leading into a house, but when he pushes it open i see to my astonishment that it encloses a court, or narrow alley.i peep down it, and as well as i can see in the blackness - for there is no lamp in the entry - i notice that there are houses at each side. filthy, ramshackle cottages, evidently let out in tenements, for they seem swarming with human beings.a man half dressed, unshaven, and unspeakably brutal looking, emerges from one of the houses. he is short and thick set, one eye is blackened, and a strip of filthy plaster adorns his left cheek. he is clad in fustian trousers and a ragged blue shirt, a wisp of rag is twisted round his neck, with the end of which he wipes his mouth preparatory to speaking. when he does speak it is to gently inquire in a hoarse voice: ""what the b----- h--- we ----- ------- ------ are doing?""the expletives roll easily off his tongue, and in the midst of his tirade he catches sight of my companion, who is keeping his blue eyes fixed sternly on his face.the effect is magical, for instantly stops his eloquence, and he disappears into the interior. in his absence we make our exit.""you see"", says mr. b----, ""there are any amount of these alleys about, and while the police are patrolling the street the lord only knows what goes on in the courts that branch from the man thoroughfare.""for instance we passed a couple of constables a few minutes ago; well, they are not able to visit and properly inspect every alley in berners street. why, we should want at least a score of men for that duty alone. look how dark the entries are. if a murder were committed in the street the murderer could easily escape observation by staying in one of the alleys till the first hue and cry was over, and then he could mix with the crowd and get off.""by this time we have got to a building which mr. b---- informs me is the club rendered notorious by being so near the scene ofthe berners street tragedy, whilst opposite is a stone block which is a board school. next to the club is a pair of high wooden gates which open inwards into the stable yard.on the right is the club, the windows of which are all lit up, and further on is the side door. opposite are three small whitewashed cottages. the place is so narrow that if the hapless victim had made the least noise it must have been heard, despite the singing and merriment that were going on in the club.a girl of about 14, barefooted and bareheaded, with a white, frightened face and sharp furtive eyes comes out of one of the houses. she starts a little when she sees us standing, and then comes across to me.""the woman was found there,"" she says, with infinite gusto smacking her lips at the chance of repeating the tale of horror to an interesting listener. ""'er head was on that short stone post, and 'er legs was just over the iron railings, and the blood and gore was all down there,"" and she pointed out the various spots mentioned with great relish.""do you live here?"" we asked.""yes, sir, in the second cottage,"" she answered.""and did you not hear anything?"" queried mr. b-----.""not a sound, sir."" says the girl, earnestly, ""and nobody else down here heard nothing neither. you know, sir, i think that""but we were fated never to hear what the girl thinks, for a voice calls out ""lizer!"" and she promptly vanished into the cottage.occasionally we meet a few brawny fellows dressed in corduroys, who peer at us curiously as they slouch along in an aimless sort of manner. mr. b---- glances at them keenly, and sometimes he smiles a little as we pass on; afterwards he tells me that they are detectives.we reach bucks row,and i may at once admit that i was agreeably surprised by it. the street is fairly wide, well paved, and not badly lit. the houses are small, but the majority are clean and respectable looking, and seem to be inhabited by the hard working poor. in fact, it is a very superior locality to berners street.the actual spot of the tragedy, although rather in the shade, is still open. there is a house with green shutters. next to it is a pair of high wooden gates; slantingly opposite is another lamp. between the lamp by the gate, lying in the road itself, was found the barbarously mutilated body of the second victim of the recent murders. to my mind this is the most mysterious crime of the lot, for it seems improbable that so ghastly an act could be perpetrated in a comparatively well-lit, thickly populated street like this, without some trace of the assassin being found, or some clew to his whereabouts being discovered.a door is open of one of the houses and it gives us an opportunity of seeing an interior so scrupulously clean, so bright and cheerful, that the remembrance of the black deed that took place outside seems to be even yet more horrible.we have seen all there is to see. we leave buck's row on our way to hanbury street.there is one exceedingly disagreeable feature of all these localities that deserves mention, and yet can necessarily be only lightly touched upon, and that is that the men and women, particularly the former, have not the least knowledge of common decency.their ignorance or wilful defiance of the most ordinary rules of decorum is apt to prove both embarrassing and uncomfortable to ordinary mortals who still think that modesty and decency exist even in the far east. the sights that i saw can better be imagined than described; indeed, a description would be peculiarly offensive, and i must admit that the women were nearly as great offenders as the men.hanbury streetis a very different locality to any we have yet been in. it is long and narrow, and unevenly paved. the houses are rather high, the majority dirty, and the whole lot swarming with inhabitants.i here remarked to mr. b---- ""that the place is not as bad as i thought.""he tells me that we are not yet in the thick of it, and he begs me to keep close to him.i soon find out that i have been too hasty in giving an opinion, for the neighborhood and the people are vile. so much we see, i with horror distended eyes, my companion with the placidity born of intimate knowledge of these slums, so much that dare not be written and can only be spoken of in whispers.the foreign element predominates. villainous-looking poles, ruffianly germans, starving russians, with the scum of half a dozen other nations all live or rather exist about here. they speak some incomprehensible jargon, they manage to find some means of earning a livelihood. i believe that they are quiet and inoffensive if left to themselves, but it is easy to see that they are looked upon with ill-concealed aversion and distrust.i quite credit mr. b-----'s statement that if the murderer was found to be a foreigner, all the police in london would be powerless to stay the persecution that the rest would be subjected to, in fact, they would behounded out of whitechapel.a man who has been glancing at us wolfishly darts forward to make a grab at the handkerchief i hold in my hand.""ah would you,"" says mr. b-------, and the would-be thief makes off.i laugh at the salutary effect that my companion produces.""they know me,"" he says; ""i have walked into one of the doss houses (lodging houses) after a man, found him there amongst a score of his pals and have marched him off quite comfortably. they have got no real pluck; why, the majority of them are miserable cowards. besides, as they often tell me, ""we're not afrightened of you, but it's the clothes you wear that we are afraid of.""we are now near the scene of the murder; there are few shops, but any number of these common lodging-houses. the place is comparatively deserted, only a few unfortunates flitting by us, very likely seeking the wherewithal to pay for a night's shelter.on our left is a house with the legend ""comfortable beds,"" written on a board outside. opposite is the lodging-house from which the hapless victim of the hanbury street tragedy was turned away to meet her death, because she had not the four pence to pay for her bed.the night is still young, so the birds of prey have not as yet returned to their noisome nests. while we stand we see several girls disappear down the various entries. one woman asks us for assistance. she say she has no money, and since the last two murders she has been afraid to go out and seek it.these woman make no secret of their calling, which they regard with callous indifference, but i cannot help thinking as we watch her go into the house opposite, that she and her class, if they could be persuaded to speak, could throw some light on the mysterious perpetrator of the crimes.the mist begins to fall in a steady melancholy drizzle, and the wind blows cold and raw. i shiver involuntarily, for the chill breeze seems to penetrate even my thick coat. the damp is surcharged with smuts and wherever they fall they leave a black smear.a cripple is sitting in a doorway;he looks wolfish and starved; a hunk of dry bread, the rejected evidently of dogs, is lying in the gutter, and this he presently sees. he gives a low cry, and with the aid of his rough crutch, he hobbles towards it, his poor maimed leg working with excitement; he clutches at the bread eagerly, drags himself back to the step and commences to gnaw and tear at the crust, more like a wild animal than anything human.his enjoyment, however, is of short duration, for a long, yellow, thieving hand, belonging to a something that bears a faint resemblance to a woman, grasps him by his frayed shirt, and with the other hand snatches the food from him and then vanishes in the mist.first the lad curses and blasphemes, and then he gives way to a dreadful misery; he moans and cries and the tears form grotesque little rivulets down his grimy face. he wishes he was dead and prays for the pluck to cut his throat; he shrieks out for the woman's heart, her vitals; he curses her with every curse, and then he falls moaning again.mr. b----- stands behind me as i drop a coin into the poor wretch's hand. he doesn't thank me but glares and blinks at me out of his wicked, tear-stained eyes, and in a low, hoarse voice says that he'll ""go and get something to eat before she comes out again.""i inquire if she is the person who took the bread from him. he nods his head volubly.""and who is she?"" i ask.""my mother,"" he responds, laconically.i shrink back the remembrance of the curses ringing in my ears, and i shudder.as we go along we pass another lodging-house, and there we see a sight so indescribably painful that i find it difficult to realize that i am in a wealthy and humane city.it is an unfortunate: young, and as well as we can see under the dirt and paint, pretty. she has boots and stockings on and an old silk skirt, with a torn velvet bodice showing the flesh through the rents. she smells strongly of spirits, and we hear her imploring the deputy to trust her for a night's shelter. she offers him anything only to let her rest there that night. he refuses; she catches him by the hand, she almost kneels to him, but he is obdurate, shakes her from him and shuts the door on her.at first the poor creature seems paralyzed, then she shrieks and batters at the door with her hands, then she sobs with impotent misery, and calls on christ to assist her.she tears at her dress, and falls to beating her bare breasts. she seems to take a fierce delight in torturing herself, for she strikes her head against the wall and drags out her lank hair by handfulls.i look stealthily at my watch, and i find that it is getting late, so we proceed to direct our footsteps toward whitechapel road, which is the first stage of my return journey homewards. as we go along theloafers increase in number.""these men,"" says mr. b-----, ""are professional loafers: they sleep and drink all day, and at night they come out of the alleys and courts and lurk about the dark corners to see who they can knock down and rob. why, if i had not been with you, you would have had every bit of your valuables stolen by this time. these fellows don't work because they won't; thieving pays them much better, and it is exciting. they know me, and they know that i know them; so that is the reason they have left us alone.""i hint a doubt as to the desirability of our detectives being so well known; but this mr. b---- laughs at.""i'm in plain clothes,"" he says, ""and the folks about here recognize me; that is, because i want them to. we are not down here on business; we are merely sight-seeing, and i did not want our pleasure to be spoiled by getting into rows which i knew we could avoid by letting my calling be clearly noticeable. you mentioned a few minutes ago that since we left berners street we have met no policemen. none we have met in uniform, but we have kept constantly running against our men so artfully dressed that you have seen no difference in them and the other individuals who were lounging about. the number of police that have been drafted down here is surprising.""we are now in commercial street, and it seems to me a very paradise after the slums we have left. the mist has cleared away, and if it were not for the all-pervading and abominable smell of fried fish, the air would be delightfully fresh in comparison with hanbury street.whitechapel road itself is a great delight to me - it is wide and noisy and presents all the appearance of a fair. either side of the road is a long row of stalls brilliantly lit up with portable gas, and everything under the sun can be bought there.there are butcher stalls presided over by loud-voiced men, who assure the bystanders that as it is late they are almost giving the meat away. a lean, pale woman carrying a baby, is haggling over the price of a piece of mutton. it is a fair-sized piece, and he at length agrees to take fourpence; she pays him in half-pennies and a little boy that is clinging to her skirt claps his thin hands rapturously.men lounge about here, but they give me the idea of idling after work is done, for they have very little of the raffish look of their berners and hanbury street compeers.in short, the east end cannot be judged from the flourishing and busy whitechapel road. it is the places that branch off from it that are so vile. it is the places where the moral sewage flows till they become hideous cesspools of vice and crime.fine ladies, and white-handed gentlemen will do no good down here; indeed nothing will remedy the evils while lighting is deficient, sanitary conveniences absent, and these filthy dark alleys exist. i say my goodbye to mr. b----- at the aldgate station and thank him, as well as i may, for his courtesy and kindness, and for his presence, which has kept me from insult and robbery in what he describes as ""one of the (if not the) worst localities in london.""and as i return to my hotel i think with a thrill of disgust of the many horrible things i have seen and heard during my night's slumming in whitechapel."

133,index/bournemouth_visitors_directory_18881114.txt,bournemouth_visitors_directory,1888-11-14,"bournemouth visitors directory (u.k.)wednesday, 14 november 1888another  horrible  murder  in  whitechapel.fearful  mutilation.yet another addition has been made to the long list of whitechapel tragedies, and still without the faintest clue being found to the perpetrator. on friday morning, about half-past ten o'clock, just as the city had decked itself in flags and garlands for the lord mayor's show, a shocking discovery was made at miller court, dorset-street, spitalfields. a young man named bowyer called at one of the rooms for the rent due to his master from an ""unfortunate"" named maria jane kelley. failing to make anyone hear, and finding the door locked, he went and informed his employer, who went back with him to the house, and putting his hand through a broken pane in the window pushed back the blind, when the horrid spectacle of a murdered woman met his gaze. the police were quickly summoned, and burst open the door.  a terrible scene presented itself. the body of the woman, perfectly nude, was stretched out on the little bed, the clothes on which were saturated with blood. the unfortunate woman had been cut and hacked by the assassin's knife in a manner which was revolting beyond all description. the fiendish assailant was not content with taking the life of his victim by severing the head from the body, but he had exercised an infernal ingenuity in despoiling the corpse of its human semblance. both ears and the nose had been cut off, and the flesh of the cheeks and forehead peeled off; the breasts were cut away, evidently with a sharp knife, and placed on the table near the bed. the abdomen had been ripped open and disemboweled, portions of the entrails laying about the bed, the liver being placed between the legs. both thighs had been denuded of flesh, laying bare the bones, and the excised portions laid on the table. one arm was almost severed from the trunk, and one hand thrust inside the empty cavity of the abdomen. medical assistance was immediately summoned, and a description of the discovery telegraphed to all the metropolitan police-stations in the terse sentence: ""the woman is simply cut to pieces.""  within a very short time half a dozen cabs arrived in dorset-street from whitehall, conveying detectives from the criminal investigation department, among them being inspectors abberline and reid. never before had so many men been despatched to the scene of a murder from whitehall.  the scene in the narrow courtway leading to the house was one of extraordinary excitement. the whole space was closely packed with detective officers, and quite a small army of plain-clothes constables was located in dorset-street within an astonishingly short space of time. dr. phillips, the divisional surgeon of police, soon arrived, and was followed by dr. bond, of westminster, divisional surgeon of the a division, and dr. j. r. gabe, of mecklenburgh-square, and two or three other surgeons.  they made a preliminary examination of the body, and sent for a photographer, who took several photographs of the remains. meanwhile the excitement in the neighbourhood was spreading, until the dwellers in the immediate locality became worked up into a perfect frenzy. women rushed about the streets telling their neighbours the news, and giving utterance in angry voices to expressions of rage and indignation. notwithstanding the stolid reticence of all the police engaged at the scene, the main facts of the crime soon became common knowledge, and, spreading far and wide, drew a great concourse of the people to the thoroughfare from which the court runs. great efforts were made at first to keep the side of dorset-street clear in the vicinity of miller-court, in the expectation that bloodhounds might have to be employed; but though it is understood that a telegram asking for them was sent to sir charles warren, they were not sent.the central news states, upon indisputable authority, that no portion of the murdered woman's body was taken away. a post-mortem examination was held by the medical authorities summoned by the police, and the surgeons did not quit their work until every organ had been accounted for, and placed as closely as possible in its natural position. in the case of his mitre-square victim, a woman picked up in the street and murdered in the open air, the murderer's motive in endeavouring to render the features unrecognisable can readily be understood. but he could scarcely suppose that the identity of a woman renting the room as a regular lodger, and well known in the immediate locality of the crime, would fail to be capable of comparatively easy proof. it is therefore assumed by experts that the cutting off of the nose and ears and the slashing of the cheeks in this case were done in a transport of mad ferocity to which monomanics are often subject.considerable doubt prevails as to the time at which the murder was committed. the discovery was made at half past ten o'clock, and it was at first stated that the woman had been seen as late as eight o'clock that morning, when she went to fetch some milk. that, however, appears to be a mistake, and the opinion of medical men who have examined the body is that in all probability the crime was committed between two and three o'clock in the morning. a woman named kennedy, who was, on the night of the murder, staying with her parents at a house situated in the court immediately opposite the room in which the body of mary kelly was found, states that about three o'clock on friday morning she entered dorset-street on her way home. she noticed three persons at the corner of the street near the britannia publichouse. there was a man - a young man, respectably dressed, and with a dark moustache - talking to a woman whom she did not know, and also a female poorly clad, and without any head gear. the man and woman appeared to be the worse for liquor, and she heard the man say, ""are you coming?"" whereupon the woman, who appeared to be obstinate, turned in an opposite direction to which the man apparently wished her to go. mrs. kennedy went on her way, and nothing unusual occurred until about half an hour later. she did not retire to rest immediately she reached home, but sat up, and between half-past three and a quarter to four she heard a cry of ""murder"" in a woman's voice proceed from the direction in which mary kelly's room was situated. as the cry was not repeated, she took no further notice of the circumstances until the morning, when she found the police in possession of the place, preventing all egress to the occupants of the small houses in this court. when questioned by the police, she made a statement to the above effect. she has since supplemented that statement by the following: -""on wednesday evening, about eight o'clock, i and my sister were in the neighbourhood of bethnal-green-road, when we were accosted by a very suspicious-looking man about 40 years of age. he was about five feet seven inches high, wore a short jacket, over which he had a long top-coat. he had a black moustache, and wore a billycock hat. he invited us to accompany him into a lonely spot, as he was known about there, and there was a policeman looking at him.""  she asserts that no policeman was in sight. he made several strange remarks, and appeared to be agitated. he was very white in the face, and made every endeavour to prevent them looking him straight in the face. he carried a black bag. he avoided walking with them, and led the way into a very dark thoroughfare, at the back of the workhouse, inviting them to follow, which they did. he then pushed open a small door in a pair of large gates, and requested one of them to follow him remarking, ""i only want one of you,"" whereupon the women became suspicious. he acted in a very strange and suspicious manner, and refused to leave his bag in possession of one of the women. they became alarmed at his actions, and escaped, at the same time raising an alarm of ""jack the ripper.""  a gentleman who was passing intercepted the man, while the women made their escape. mrs. kennedy asserts that the man whom she saw on friday morning with the woman at the corner of dorset-street resembled very closely the individual who caused such alarm on wednesday night, and that she would recognise him again if confronted with him.a gentleman engaged in business in the vicinity of the murder stated on sunday that he was walking through mitre-square at about ten minutes past ten on friday morning, when a tall, well-dressed man, carrying a parcel under his arm, and rushing along in a very excited manner, ran into him. the man's face was covered with blood splashes, and his collar and shirt were also blood-stained. the gentleman did not at the time know anything of the murder.the young man, with whom the deceased had recently been living, gave himself up to the police on friday, and was able satisfactorily to account for his movements on thursday night. a pilot-coat found in the deceased's room has also been accounted for.the  inquest  -  a  shocking  revelation.the inquest on the body was held at the shoreditch town hall, on monday, before dr. macdonald, m.p. describing the proceedings, the daily news says:  the first witness was joseph barnet [barnett]. he had lived with the deceased for a year and eight months, and appeared to be in pretty full possession of all the main facts in the unhappy woman's history. a very deplorable history it proved to be. she had been married at 16 to a welsh collier, who was killed in an explosion. she had then gone to cardiff with a cousin, who, the witness said, had been the cause of her downfall, and from there had come to london, to a madam somebody in the west-end. a gentleman had then taken her to france, and from france, after a short time, she came over to ratcliff highway. subsequently she had lived with two men in succession, to the latter of whom she had been greatly attached. he (the witness) had met her casually in whitechapel, they had had a drink together, and arranged the compact which seems to have held good till the 30th of last month, when, out of compassion, she had taken into her room an immoral woman, and over this they quarrelled and parted. the main interest of this man's story runs in the gruesome light it threw on a profligate career of eight short years. it did nothing [to] elucidate the mystery of her death, nor indeed did any of the evidence given. through the phantasmagoria of the coroner's court there did indeed flit figures, probably more or less apocryphal, of men who might have done the deed. one doleful-looking little body, with a negress-type of features, told how she and and another had been frightened by a mysterious stranger who had tried to lure them by the offer of money into a retired spot;  but they both took to their heels and ran away. not much importance was to be attached to this testimony, probably, nor to that of one or two others who had seen men under suspicious circumstances. perhaps the most sensational bit of evidence tendered was that of a garrulous young woman who, with some dramatic force, imitated by voice and action a sort of nightmare cry of ""oh! murder!"" which she declared she had heard just after she had been woke up by her kitten rubbing its nose against her face about half-past three or four o'clock on the morning of the murder. it was a faintish cry, she said, as though somebody had woke up with the nightmare, and though the evidence must be taken with the reserve that should attach to all such testimony, the time at which she believes she heard the cry would tally very well with all the circumstances of the case, and it is not impossible that that really was the death gasp of the poor woman in the clutches of her murderer. some confirmation is added to this supposition by the evidence of another witness, sarah lewis, who lived a short distance off, but had had some falling out at home, and went to stay the night with a friend at miller's-court, where she sat and dozed in a chair. she woke up about 3:30 by spitalfields church clock, and a little before four o'clock - agreeing with this with the other witness - she also heard one cry of ""murder!"". she, however, says it was a loud shout, whereas another witness, who was awake the whole of the night, and who believes she must have heard any such cry if it had been made, swore that she heard not a sound. as to the evidence of the woman caroline maxwell, who swore that she saw the deceased at eight or nine o'clock on friday morning, that is regarded by the police as merely an error of date. no doubt she did see the woman, and spoke to her as she stated, but on thursday morning instead of friday. nothing was said as to the probable time of the murder, but we have reason to believe that the conclusion arrived at by several medical men who were on the spot shortly after the discovery of the body was that the deed had been done certainly not later than six or seven on friday morning, and it might have been a good deal earlier. inspector abberline, of the scotland-yard detectives, in reply to questions as to the probable reason of certain articles of clothing having been burnt in kelly's grate, expressed his belief that they had been burnt to light the murderer in his ghastly work. dr. phillips's evidence was conclusive as to the cause of death. it had resulted from the severance of the right carotid artery; and, after the throat had been cut, the body, said the doctor, must have been removed from one side of the bed to the other. as to the mutilation of the body, no evidence was given beyond that of the death wound; and, as dr. phillips's evidence was absolutely conclusive as to the cause of death, and the police had no testimony to produce indicating the criminal, dr. macdonald put it to the jury whether it was necessary to go any further. he did not wish unduly to influence them, but all they had to do was to determine the cause of the woman's death, and if they thought that had been sufficiently proved, there would be no occasion for an adjournment. after a brief deliberation the jury came unanimously to the conclusion that they had carried the inquiry far enough, and that the matter might now be left in the hands of the police. they accordingly returned a verdict of ""wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.""description  of  the  probable  murderer.on monday evening the police received information of a most important nature, which not only establishes a clue to the perpetrator of the dorset-street murder, but places the authorities in possession of an accurate and full description of a person who was seen in company with the murdered woman during the night on which she met her death. a man, apparently of the labouring class, but of a military appearance, who knew the deceased, on monday night lodged with the police a long and detailed statement of an incident which attracted his attention on the day in question. the following is a summary of the statement, and it may be said that notwithstanding examination and re-examination by the police, the man's story cannot be shaken, and so circumstantial and straightforward were his assertions that the police believe they have at length been placed in possession of facts which will open up a new line of investigation, and probably enable them to track the criminal. this man states that on the morning of the 9th instant he saw the deceased woman, mary janet kelley, in commercial-street, spitalfields (the vicinity where the murder was committed), in company with a man of respectable appearance. the man was about 5 feet 6 inches in height, and 34 or 35 years of age, with dark complexion and dark moustache curled up at the ends. he was wearing a long dark coat trimmed with astrachan, a white collar with black necktie, in which was affixed a horseshoe pin. he wore a pair of dark gaiters with light buttons, over button boots, and displayed from his waistcoat a massive gold chain. the highly respectable appearance of this individual was in such great contrast to that of the woman that few people could have failed to remark them at that hour of the morning. this description, which substantiates that given by others of the person seen in company with the deceased on the morning she was killed, is much fuller in detail than that hitherto in the possession of the police, and the importance they attach to this man's story may be imagined when it is mentioned that it was forwarded to the headquarters of the h division as soon as completed by a special detective. detective abberline, nairn, and moore were present when this message arrived, and an investigation was immediately set on foot.why  the  bloodhounds  were  not  used.an inquiry has been made to elicit the facts with reference to the non-employment of bloodhounds immediately the tragedy of dorset-street was discovered. it appears that, at sir charles warren's request, mr. brough, the well-known bloodhound breeder, of scarborough, was communicated with shortly after the mitre-square and berner-street outrages, and asked to bring a couple of trained hounds up to london for the purpose of testing their capabilities in the way of following the scent of the man. the hounds were named burgho and barnaby, and in one of the trials sir charles warren himself acted as the quarry, and expressed satisfaction, at the result. arrangements were made for the immediate conveyance of the animals to the spot in the event of another murder occurring, and in order to facilitate matters mr. brough, who was compelled to return to scarborough, left the hounds in the care of a friend of his, mr. taunton, of doughty-street, who was entrusted with their custody pending the conclusion of the negotiations which had been opened for the ultimate purchase of the dogs. sir charles warren, however, would not give any definite assurance on this point, and mr. brough insisted on resuming possession of the animals. one of them, burgho, was sent to a show at brighton, the other remaining in mr. taunton's custody. about a fortnight ago this gentleman received a telegram from leman-street police-station, asking him to bring the dog to assist in discovering the perpetrators of a burglary in commercial-street. the police then admitted that subsequently to the burglary they had been all over the premises, and mr. taunton pointed out to them that it was absurd to expect that the bloodhounds could accomplish anything under such conditions. the owner of the dogs, on learning these facts, telegraphed peremptorily insisting that barnaby should be returned to him at once, having in view the danger of the hound being poisoned if it was known that the police were employing it to track burglars - and mr. brough had no guarantee of compensation in case of the animal suffering maltreatment. from these circumstances it will be seen that there has been no trained bloodhound in the metropolis at any time during the past fortnight. the whitechapel officials themselves were not aware of this fact, for their first thought on receiving the intelligence of the murder was to leave the room absolutely undisturbed until the hounds should be brought on the scene, and it was only when they learnt that there were no bloodhounds to be had that an entrance was effected into the chamber.a  letter  from  jack  the  ripper.mrs. mccarthy, the wife of the landlord of the house where the murder occurred, has received a postcard bearing the folkestone postmark, and signed ""jack sheridan, the ripper.""  in bad spelling and equally bad caligraphy, the writer said, ""don't be alarmed. i am going to do another; but this time it will be a mother and daughter.""  the postcard, unlike any of the previous communications of a similar character, was written in black ink, and the writing did not bear any resemblance to that of previous communications. it was at once handed over to the detectives.resignation  of  sir  charles  warren.replying to a question addressed to him by mr. conybeare, in the house of commons on monday, the home secretary announced that sir charles warren, on the 8th inst., tendered his resignation as chief commissioner of the metropolitan police, and the resignation had been accepted.the press association learns ""on the highest authority"" that the relations between sir charles warren and the home office have for some time been strained. the action of the department in reference to the resignation of mr. monro caused the first serious difference of opinion. sir charles took exception to certain of the methods of the assistant commissioner, and he intimated to mr. matthews that either he or mr. monro must resign. a few days afterwards mr. monro's resignation was announced. sir charles complains that mr. monro's resignation was accepted without consultation with him, and that prior to the home secretary's statement in the house of commons on monday evening he (sir charles warren) was not even aware of the reason assigned by his subordinate for severing his connection with scotland-yard. since mr. monro's transference to the home office matters have become worse. sir charles complains that, whereas he has been saddled with all the responsibility, he has had no freedom of action, and in consequence his position has become daily more unbearable. although mr. monro has been no longer in evidence at whitehall-place, he has to all intents and purposes retained control of the criminal investigation department. indeed, mr. matthews on monday evening admitted that he was deriving the benefit of the advice of mr. monro in matters relating to crime, and was in communication with him at the present time on the subject of the organization of the detective staff. this division of authority sir charles warren has strenuously fought against. he maintains that if the commissioner is to be responsible for the discipline of the force instructions should be given to no department without his concurrence. latterly, in spite of the remonstrances of sir charles warren, the control of the criminal investigation department has been withdrawn more and more from whitehall place. every morning for the last few weeks there has been a protracted conference at the home office between mr. monro, mr. anderson, and the principal detective inspectors, and the information furnished to the commissioner in regard to those conferences has been, he states, of the scantiest character. these facts will explain how, apart from any other consideration, it was impossible for sir charles warren, holding the views he did in regard to the functions of the commissioner, to continue in command. the reproof of the home secretary last week in reference to the article in murray's magazine completed the rupture. sir charles thereupon took counsel with his friends, and immediately tendered his resignation to the home secretary. on monday morning his books and papers were removed from the commissioner's office, and this was the first intimation in whitehall-place that he had relinquished the position."

""his occupation,"" like othello's, ""was gone.""  he made a hit  in another direction, however, rumor having it that, like the  venerable mr. turveydrop, he had succeeded in making a good living  out of his ""deportment,"" having gained the heart and hand of the  heiress of one of the richest families on the heights, who fell in  love with him while on a professional visit.the establishment of the doctor, which was situatedin fulton streetnear to nassau, consisted of a suite of three rooms which he  occupied as an office and sleeping apartments.  besides the doctor  these rooms generally had two other occupants,and it is of one of these that this article is written.  these two  men were the hangers on or dependents of the doctor, occupying  different positions, however, in his esteem.  the taller of them  was treated by the doctor as a sort of confidential valet, while  the other one, who was shorter and of a stouter build, performed  the duties of hostler to the two stylish looking piebald horses, on  which the doctor and his confidential valet were wont to excite the  admiration of foolish females.  the most remarkable thing about the  doctor's establishment was the manner in which his wardrobe was  distributed.  almost every day the doctor had on some new garment,  and on the same day, the one which he had worn on the previous one  would be seen on the back of his valet, and the next day from the  valet to the hostler, and from thence for aught we know to the  second hand clothes' dealers.  everybody who has been in the habit  of travelling in fulton street during the past year, will have a  distinct recollection of the doctor and his valet, and it was at  the time a general subject of remark, that the valet seemed to ape  almost unconsciously all the airs of his master, and appeared to  pay him the same deference which those who generally accompanied  them did.  this fact will be recalled with fearful distinctness now  by many who formerly noticed it, for this accomplice of booth and  harold, who was arrested as above stated, and who knows the parties  well, stated to the police that this soi distant valet was  none other than the notorious haroldwho is now awaiting the just punishment of his horrible crime, and  it would seem that he had attached himself to the indian herb  doctor in the same manner in which he subsequently attached himself  to booth from a womanish sort of admiration for his supposed  cleverness.the history of their acquaintancewas stated by the boy to be as follows: shortly before the arrival  of the doctor here, he made the acquaintance of j. wilkes booth in  washington, and through him became acquainted with harold.  harold,  who had some knowledge of the drug business, was then out of  employment and the doctor, who was just then in need of a person of  that sort to accompany him, offered harold a chance to go with him  and harold accepted the offer.  when the doctor was compelled by  the force of circumstances to abandon his lucrative position here,  harold went back to washington, and this was the last that was  heard of him until the commission of the fearful tragedy which has  eternally linked his name to infamy."

at st louis.-----the arrest of dr. tumblety, whose intimate and confidential  relations with harold, the conspirator, were first published in the  eagle, is thus fully set forth by a st. louis paper:the following paragraph from a telegraphic dispatch, was published  in all the papers yesterday morning:it appears harold turns out to have been the agent and confident of  the notorious dr. tumblety, who lately suddenly disappeared from  brooklyn.the ""notorious dr. tumblety"" spoken of, who has for some time past  been massing a fortune in this city, under the nome de plume of the  indian herb doctor, and who had previously assumed the name of dr.  j. h. blackburn, was yesterday arrested by a united states  detective, on a charge of complicity with the assassination of  president lincoln.  dr. tumblety will be summoned to washington to  undergo examination.  harold and the herb doctor are said to have  been partners in brooklyn, and this bare fact may have given rise  to the report which is now circulated through the telegraph.  the  doctor maintains that the charge is utterly without foundation, and  it is rumored that he will demand of the provost marshal full  restitution or exoneration.tumblety is a character of national or international reputation.   his eccentricities and oddities are the subject of general comment  here, and have awakened curiosity in all the principal cities of  the country.  he originally started in his career, we believe, in  rochester, n.y., where, when quite a boy, he was employed at first  as servant or errand boy in the office of dr. lispenard, on  exchange place, a celebrated special practioner.  he afterwards  studied medicine with lispenard, and graduated in a short time, and  it is stated left rochester unceremoniously.  in 1857 he appeared  in toronto, canada, and opened an office on king street, where  crowds of people daily flocked to his rooms to test his wonderful  vegetable cures.in front of his office was displayed as a sign, a large pair of  buck horns, which he claimed were presented to him by an indian  chief named ""sundown,"" a savage of the plains, with whom he was  intimately acquainted.  in toronto he was periodically assailed and  denounced by the resident physicians for practicing without license  and invading upon their rights.  be that the case or not, he  certainly reaped large grains from his eccentric pretensions, and  produced numerous witnesses to attest the skill with which he cured  human ailments.  he next visited montreal, canada east, and went  through the same programme, being assailed by the regular  profession.  the public prints at the time in that city berated the  doctor extensively, and it is stated that he was compelled to leave  the city on account of cases instituted against him in the courts.   whether such prosecutions were but part of the persecution he was  subjected to or not, we leave the public to judge.in '62 the doctor turned up in washington city and located his  office on pennsylvania avenue.  he was the general feature of  curiosity in the city, drawing attent[i]on from the distinguished  men of the nation and exciting general remark on account of his  peculiarities of dress.  it is said that he would appear in two or  three different outfits upon the street in as many hours, being  always known by his tall form and dignified step, his curly hair  and mammoth moustache.often would he be seen down the prominent thoroughfare, mounted  upon a spotted circus horse, richly accoutred, and displaying fine  horsemanship, or at other times would appear upon the promenade  followed by a fine looking mulatto and a mouse-colored hound, which  he still retain[s].  since that time he has visited new orleans and  nearly all the principal cities of the united states, meeting  everywhere with ast[o]unding success--the lion among the bloods,  and the gayest of the gay.  it is said that he never returns to a  place after once leaving it, but bears with him always, great  pecuniary consolation.it is stated that several years ago, the doctor visited buffalo, n .y., and announced to the public, through the columns of the press,  that he would, the day following, meet any merchant of that city on  the steps of the merchants' exchange, and there distribute fifty  sacks of flour to the poor.  the proprietors of one of the papers,  desiring to know more about the doctor, telegraphed to toronto,  inquiring who he was, when the answer came back from the bank of  toronto, ""his check ir good for $60,000 in this bank."" at the  appointed time the doctor distributed to the poor his fifty bags of  flour, and the next day published advertisements and issued hand  bills, announcing to the too credulous public that he was cure ""all  the ills that flesh is heir to.""  of course, his charity was more  than repaid.in this city his history is one of unprecedented success and great  notoriety.  his eccentricities of dress and business ingenuity have  been subjects of comment for some time.  his offices have been  crowded with applicants for medical relief, and the daily papers  have been filled with notices of his ""wonderful cures.""  it is said  that when he first opened his office on olive street, he hired a  newsboy to perambulate the streets, with his face painted red like  an indian boy, and his head adorned with long feathers.  this boy  would stand at the foot of the stairs, and deal out to passers  programmes and ""dodgers.""  most of our readers will doubtless  remember the arrest of the doctor some time ago by the provost  guard for appearing in the street in military clothing."

witness fifty other  cases all over the land. there are no finer and more complete  detective and police systems than those of london. people get in  the habit on both sides of blaming the police when offenders are  not immediately caught. my wonder is that, with the acumen  possessed by many of these offenders the police are able to  overtake then as soon as they do. sometimes crime is epidemic and  breaks out in many different places at the same time and it seems  to be owing to something in the atmosphere. the east wind is the  mother of all sorts of villainies, while the northwest wind is the  most favorable wind for honesty and good order. but this london  affair must not be looked upon as an epidemic, as all the work  appears to be the product of one brain and one hand. i can easily  understand how there should be a feverish and unnatural excitement  as the result of these desperations. when i was residing in  philadelphia there was considerable excitement over what was called  the india rubber man. women out at night declared that they had  seen man with the most extraordinary jumping capacities, which  seemed to come from extraordinary india rubber appliances or from a  supernatural gift of powers equal to the same. some had seen him  leap from curb to curb and others had seen him vault over the tops  of houses without any apparent means of assistance. during the  excitement i was absent. one friday evening i returned home barely  in time to get to prayer meeting. i was, of course, unaware of any  extraordinary event or excitement. it was wet and stormy and hastily  donning my waterproof outfit i hurried down the street at full  speed. just before reaching the church i met a couple of women. i  turned to pass them, still on a run, when they suddenly threw down  their umbrellas and gave most unearthly screeches. the next moment,  fortunately for me, i appeared under the full glare of a lamp and  they at once recovered self possession and composure. i was, of  course, greatly perplexed that the women should be so frightened over  an inoffending person hurrying along the street to prayer meeting  and i did not fully understand when i heard one of them say, as i  passed by, ""o, i thought it was the india rubber man.""""dr. talmage in concluding added a good word for the police. he said  he never understood that the police more than other human mortals  claimed omnipresence. their comparatively small numbers in the  cities of new york and brooklyn make it impossible for them to be  all over at once. he said he had watched the policemen on their  beats at all hours of day and night, going to and from houses of  sickness and trouble, and had never found a man yet off duty or  intoxicated or in anywise acting improperly. many he knew  personally who were hard working, faithful public servants, good  husbands and kind fathers.referring to examples of the loss of reason, he said: ""the best and  mightiest had been mentally shipwrecked. robert hall, the great  baptist clergyman of bristol and of all christendom, as consecrated  and brilliant a man as the christian pulpit ever had, had again and  again been incarcerated in the insane asylum. john brown, the  scotch essayist, died in a straight jacket, and alexander cruden  wrote the concordance, the greatest work ever prepared beside the  bible, during his lucid spells and between repeated periods of  incarceration."""

that the  crime was probably the work of ""jack the ripper"". and that the  murderer was frightened away by the approach of some pedestrian  before he had time to mutilate the body in the manner already  described in the previous crimes attributed to ""jack the ripper.""on the other hand, it is known that the residents of whitechapel in  particular and of london in general are prone to give credit to "" jack the ripper"" for any murder or attempt at murder in  whitechapel, where a woman is concerned.the body, after the usual formalities taken with the object of  establishing the woman's identity and of finding a clue to the  murderer had been gone through with in the usual stereotyped  manner, was taken to the whitechapel mortuary. the blood was still  warm when the body was found. when the blood stains had been  cleared awy the police carved a rough cross in the wood work over  the spot in swallow's gardens where the unfortunate woman was  found, in order to mark the spot where the crime was perpetrated.  large crowds of people, naturally, gathered around swallow's  gardens this morning in spite of the heavy efforts of scores of  detectives and of uniformed and plain clothes police of the  division. there seems to be, as in so many other and similar cases,  no definite clew to the murderer. no arrests have been made.a railroad employee, it is true, says he saw the murdered woman  talking to a man, apparently a foreign seaman, just previous to the  time the murder is supposed to have been committed, and the police  are now engaged in searching all the vessels lying in the thames or  in the many docks about the port of london. the policeman who found  the murdered woman must have reached the spot while the murderer  was only a few yards away, for the woman's lips were still  twitching nervously and her eyes were still rolling when the  officer bent over her and a moment later sounded his whistle in a  call for assistance, which must have placed any policeman in the  neighborhood on the alert.a woman's hat was found near the scene of the murder concealed by a  piece of drapery. this hat was, in addition to the one on the  murdered woman's head, suggestive, according to the london police,  that either the ""ripper"" or the woman was disguised.the spot where the murdered woman's body was found was not a  stone's throw from a police station.upon being questioned by his superior officer, the policeman who  found the body said that, in addition to the nervous twitching of  the lips and the rolling of the eyes already referred to, the  woman's limbs were moving when he found her. consequently, she must  have been still alive when the policeman bent over her. the officer  added that as soon as he discovered that a crime had been committed  he rushed to the end of the archway and sounded an alarm with his  whistle, while the ""ripper"" must have escaped through the  neighboring streets. a large number of people who were immediately  attracted to the scene of the murder by the police alarm assisted  the scores of officers who soon appeared in searching the  neighboring doorways, alleyways, dark nooks and corners where a man  could conceal himself.the wound across the murdered woman's throat was evidently caused  by a sharp, powerful stroke, and nothing can shake the belief of  the police that but for the approach of some pedestrian, possibly  the policeman who found the body, would have been mutilated in a  manner similar to that of the other whitechapel murders.the woman found murdered in swallow's gardens has been identified  as an unfortunate known as ""carroty nell"".later: the police have arrested a man on suspicion of being  concerned in the murder of the unfortunate woman.

corner of  catharine and water streets, new york, was the victim of a man  known as ""frenchy"". the man's cousin, george francois, is a  prisoner and is held as a witness. the police say the man who did  the deed is still at large. the cousin is also known as ""frenchy.""  a mysterious prisoner was brought to police headquarters yesterday  afternoon. there are reasons to suppose that this man is the one  who killed the old woman. it was after this man was brought to  police headquarters that inspector byrnes made the statement. it  was type written and was read by acting inspector mclaughlin at the  oak street station house and in the presence of inspector byrnes.  it is incomplete, but neither inspector byrnes nor captain  mclaughlin would answer any of a number of questions put by  reporters to cover the deficiencies.the statement sets forth that mary miniton, the housekeeper at the  east river hotel, admits that she had known the murdered woman for  a number of years. she was known to her both as shakespeare and as  jeff davis. frenchy, the man under arrest, admits that on the night  previous to the murder he occupied a room with shakespeare in the  east river hotel and that he was in the hotel, but not in the room  with the woman, the night she was murdered. the man suspected of  having committed the murder is also known as frenchy, and is  believed to be this man's cousin because the several women held as  witnesses say the two men spoke of each other as cousins. the  frenchy who is held as a witness refuses to give any information  regarding the missing man who is known to be a native of assyria.  he speaks an arabic-french dialect. he was arrested january 24 last  for biting mary lopez, one of the women now held as a witness. he  was her companion in the east river hotel the night he bit the  woman. all the women held as witnesses knew him and could identify  him. he has been known to the inmates of low dives in the fourth  ward for several months.this is all the police would say about the murderer. they have  looked up the history of the wretched old woman who was so  shockingly murdered. they say of her that she first appeared in new  york about fifteen years ago. she was then a fine looking woman, of  middle age, very intelligent and quite refined, though addicted to  drink. because of her intelligence she came to be known as  shakespeare. why she was also dubbed jeff davis no one seems to  know. she became very popular among those with whom she associated  because of her liberality and for her superior intelligence. she  had plenty of money, and when under the influence of liquor she  would spend it freely or would give it away. she rapidly sunk, and  soon became as low as the lowest of the women in water street,  although she would frequently disappear and when she returned she  would seem to have suspended her drinking and other low habits  while absent. she returned periodically to her low companions in  the low water street dives.detective crowley, the statement continued, discovered a woman who  knew shakespeare well and who informed the detective that her name  was croline montgomery and that in early life she became the wife a  captain james brown, who sailed a ship from salem, mass., where  they lived. captain brown died and left her a fortune. she came to  new york shortly after her  husband's death and settled in a  respectable part of the fourth ward. she had then become a victim  of liquor and when under its influence she drifted to the low dives  a few blocks away. the women of these places made her very welcome  because of her money and she soon spent most of her time with them.  she has often been arrested and sent to blackwell's island. when  she disappeared from her chums she was an inmate of an old womens'  home, where her board was paid by a relative named lawson, who is a  resident of salem. she was last discharged from the blackwell's  island prison a few days ago. her two daughters, ellen and annie,  still live at salem.the above is the statement given by the police. when questions were  asked about the previous history of frenchy it was said that there  was nothing more to say than what had been said.every dive in the fourth ward has been visited by detectives, and  when the eagle reporter went to those places to get information  about the man who is suspected, the dive keepers said they had  never heard of him, although they had told the reporter before that  they knew him well.the mysterious prisoner at police headquarters was brought in by  captain reilly and detective britt of the nineteenth precinct and  detective sergeant hanley of the central office. his hands were  tied behind him and he was closely guarded by the three officers.  he reached headquarters, on mulberry street, at 3:50 p.m. later he  was taken to the oak street station house. he answered the  description given by mary miniter of the man who occupied the room  with mrs. brown the night she was murdered. his clothing was the  same as  that given by mary, with the exception of the trousers,  which were different from those worn by the man thursday night.it was stated in yesterday's eagle that a policeman brought a pair of  trousers that were stained with blood to the fourth precinct police  station yesterday morning, and that he spoke of having got them at  a bowery lodging house. the police refused to speak of these  trousers. the fact that the mysterious prisoner answered the  description of the wanted man in all particulars except as to the  trousers, would indicate that after having killed the woman the  murderer went to a bowery lodging house, and finding that some of  his victim's blood was on his trousers he secured another pair,  leaving the bloodstained pair behind him. when inspector byrnes was  asked about this mysterious prisoner he replied: ""o, he is a small  thief we have wanted for a long time. i assure you he is a bum.""  but he would not say who the small thief was or why a police  captain and two detectives guarded him so closely and had his hands  pinioned.deputy coroner jenkens (sic) who made the autopsy on the body of  the murdered woman, was seen by a reporter of the eagle after he  had finished his scientific examination. he said: ""i do not claim,  as had been reported, that the slashing must have been done by a  left handed man, or that i am sure she was cut before she was dead.  that she was strangled there is no doubt, but whether she was cut  before she died from strangulation or immediately after death no one  can tell. it is evident that great force was used in the clutch at  her throat. the liquid condition of the blood in the heart would  indicate that strangulation and not hemorrhage caused death, and  yet the amount of bleeding would indicate that she was not quite  dead or at least that the body was still warm when she was cut. i  found one long incision from the top of the right hip bone  descending obliquely across the abdomen to the bubes (sic). the  intestines protruded from this cut. it appears that after the cut  was made the body was turned over and the cut was continued from  the pubes upward and backward beyond the base of the backbone.  there are also two long scratches in front and a perfect cross  scratched in the skin at the back of the thigh.""""was the cutting such as would have been done by a surgeon as the  cutting done by jack the ripper of london, is said to be?"" asked  the reporter.""if it was done by a surgeon he was a butcher. it was horrible  hacking.""""would you suppose this murder was committed by the london jack the  ripper?""""i am not advancing theories. i cannot say.""water and cherry streets have not witnessed so quiet a saturday  night as last night in many years. the fourth ward was overrun with  detectives and the fallen women seemed to be more afraid of them  than they did of jack the ripper. the dives were all open, as  usual, but the women kept indoors. the east river hotel was doing a  big business and the low patrons of the house indulged in coarse  jokes about the awful tragedy that was enacted there two night  before.inspector byrnes seemed more at ease after captain reilly's  prisoner had been brought in. his detectives were still busy  rushing about the fourth ward, but he returned to his normal  condition of self confidence. the general opinion of those about  police headquarters were that he had his man, but wanted to fasten  the crime upon him without a doubt before he would speak of his  catch.captain o'connor of the oak street station strengthened the belief  that the murderer, or at least the man suspected, had been arrested  by announcing to the reporters shortly before midnight that they  might go home, because he said: ""i assure you that no information  will be given our before tomorrow afternoon. even if we got the man  we are looking for there would be so many things to clear up that  nothing could be given for publication before tomorrow afternoon.""  steve brody seems desirous of getting all the cheap notoriety he  can out of this case. he announced yesterday that he could tell who  the murdered woman was, and he had a statement printed in a new  york paper about her life, which proved to be untrue. then he told  reporters that his wife had found parts of the intestines of a  woman in the street, near the scene of the murder, and that he had  sent them to the police at the oak street station. the police  denied that they had received anything from brody, but deputy  coroner jenkins admitted that the police had sent him a package and  he examined the contents, which proved to be parts of the organs of  a cat."

193,index/brooklyn_daily_eagle_18910425.txt,brooklyn_daily_eagle,1891-04-25,"brooklyn daily eaglenew york, usa25 april 1891the ""jack the ripper"" butcherythe police of the second precinct in brooklyn this morning arrested  a man on suspicion of being the perpetrator of the horrible ""jack  the ripper"" murder in new york, but investigation showed they were  mistaken, and the prisoner was released. whether the person  responsible for this most fiendish atrocity is the one who, within  the past few months, has spread terror throughout london, is yet to  be demonstrated. but there is an apparent similarity of motive, and  the attendant circumstances are so strikingly identical that those  inclined to believe that ""jack the ripper"" is really here may very  readily be pardoned. certainly if the murderer is merely an  imitator of the wretch who has shed so much blood in the  whitechapel districts of london, he has patterned his course so  closely after that of his model that it is hard to detect any  material difference. beyond doubt, the atrocity is the most  revolting that in recent years, at least, has been presented to the  gaze of the people of new york and brooklyn, accustomed as they are  to deeds of violence and bloodshed.the main question, of course, relates to the degree of energy and  ability to be displayed by the police in capturing the assassin.  whether or not the new york police authorities have distinctly  affirmed that the whitechapel butcheries could not possibly have  been committed in the american metropolis without the murderer  being caught is now a disputed point; at all events, there has been  a general expression of confidence in our superior detective skill,  and this has led to the belief that the perpetrator of the london  horrors could not escape detection on this side of the ocean. here,  then, is a superb opportunity for the vindication of that  sentiment. inspector byrnes and his men cannot claim that the task  which has fallen to their lot is any more difficult than that which  puzzled the scotland yard detectives, for, as a matter of fact,  they have several things in their favor which the english policemen  were denied. no matter at what cost of money or energy, or how  drastic the methods employed, the murderer, it is to be hoped, will  be captured before he claims another victim.  many arrestsbut no identification of ""jack the ripper.""  that the man who butchered the wretched old creature known as  shakespeare in the east river hotel is ""jack the ripper"" of london  coroner shultz, who has charge of the case, has but little doubt.  he believes the london fiend has visited new york and has begun a  series of butcheries here such as those committed by him in london.  whether it is or is not ""jack the ripper"" the new york butcher  seems thus far to have completely covered his tracks, and inspector  byrnes may not be able to show the police of london how easily he  could catch the man who gave them so much trouble over there.the old woman, who was known only as shakespeare among her cronies  in the slums of water street, was a woman far superior in many ways  to those with whom she associated. she was nicknamed shakespeare  because of her knowledge of literature. it was stated in a new york  morning paper that it had been ,earned that she was an old hanger  on on the low resorts of the east side. coroner shultz says this is  not so. he believes he knows who she is, but he will not tell her  name at present. he said to a reporter of the eagle: ""this woman  has occupied a good position in life. she was a domestic recently  but was brought down to that level because of her love for drink.  she was well connected and well educated. she was not the mary  brown described in the morning paper. i do not wish to say who she  was at present. it will come out later.""""do you think she was killed by jack the ripper?"" asked the  reporter.""i believe this case is the same as those of london. in this case  the murderer first strangled his victim and then mutilated the  body. there are plain marks of his thumb and fingers on her throat.  it would appear she was so drunk that she could offer but little  resistance. he bought her some ale, which she probably drank and  then fell off into a drunken stupor when he deliberately strangled  her. he wound her clothing about her head, but whether this was  done before or after he choked her i do not know. it may be that he  did this first, believing that in her drunken sleep she would thus  be strangled and that as she continued to breath he hastened her  death by chocking her with a clutch of his fingers on her throat.  it is certain that she was dead before she was cut. the fellow  hacked her body much as the bodies of the london victims of jack  the ripper were hacked. the cut was from the base of the spine up  across the abdomen to the breast bone. it was made with the knife  found in the room. it was such a cut as must have been made slowly  and deliberately. it would appear as though the murderer had pulled  the intestines out and spread them on the bed. then he turned the  body over and with the point of his knife scratched a cross on the  skin of the left thigh. i do not see any reason to suppose that the  crime may not have been committed by the fiend of london.""inspector byrnes is doing detective in person, and he has every  available man in the department on the case. as soon as he found  that it was possible that ""jack the ripper"" was operating, he set  to work with all the machinery at his command to run down the  murderer. he put out his drag net in the fourth ward and soon had a  big catch at the fourth precinct station house, on oak street,  where he had made his headquarters. each prisoner brought in was  closely questioned. many of them were allowed to depart. it was  thought that george francois, who is known as ""frenchy"" among the  inmates of the low dives, might be the man. the fellow had no  difficult in proving that he occupied another room in the same  house on the night of the murder. he was held as a witness, as were  william bekker, mary healey, lizzie carter, mary lopez, alice  sullivan and mary minite (sic).mary healey was the chum of the dead woman. she was too drunk to  tell what she knew when arrested. the police are too cautious to  tell what she told when she sobered up. william behken (sic) is  considered to be an important witness. what he knows the police  will not tell. inspector byrnes ran down new chambers street and  rushed into the oak street police station at 11 o'clock this  morning. he disappeared into captain o'connor's private office and  soon reappeared, followed by a detective. the latter did not move  as rapidly as the inspector seemed to think he should and the  inspector lost his temper and scolded at the man for not hastening.  the two rushed to the city hall station of the elevated railroad  and went uptown.inspector byrnes has not slept since he learned of the murder  yesterday morning, and he has been rushing about just as he rushed  in and out of the oak street station house, ever since. everything  that looks like an important clew receives his personal attention.  he is on trial before the world, and he seems to know it. the  morning newspapers published dispatches telling of the joy in  scotland yard because of his inability to catch this man after he  had boasted that ""jack the ripper"" could not do in new york what he  had done in london. the inspector has a large acquaintance with  crooks and thieves.it has been his policy to not prosecute a thief for a petty offense  if he believed by not doing so he could use the petty thief in  helping to convict one guilty of a more serious offense. he would  take the petty thief into his office, draw a confession from him  and then advise him to be honest in the future and let him go. a  watch would be set on this man and the inspector would soon know  who his companions were. if one of his companions was suspected of  a crime the petty thief would be brought to the inspector and he  would be given to understand that the only way he could escape  imprisonment for his old offense would be by helping the police in  the more important case. he would help the police. nine out of ten  on the block of water street which terminates at the east river  hotel have been guilty of some petty offenses that the inspector  knows of. each of these is an assistant of the police in this case,  but none of them seems to be able to give any information that will  lead to the discovery of the butcher. he seems to have come from no  one knows where and to have slipped away without having formed any  acquaintances among the people of the dives of water or cherry  street. there is no other part of new york that resembles the  whitechapel district of london as water street does. the hovels  here are filthy, low places whose income is derived entirely from  drunken sailors. the women who lure sailors into the dive are  wretched creatures. the only men other than drunken sailors who go  to these places are pert thieves who help the women rob sailors.  these are dens of vice that are not gilded. the houses of infamy  are dirty, wretched places. it is just such a place as this that "" jack the ripper"" would select to operate in should he be in new  york. the man who committed this deed evidently studied his ground  well. the saloon under the east river hotel closes at 1 o'clock in  the morning, although after that hour drinks are sold to those who  occupy rooms. ""shakespeare"" and her murderer entered this house  before midnight. the murderer could not have gone out either  through the hotel entrance or through the saloon without having  asked someone to unlock a door. no one unlocked a  door for him. he  could and probably did leave the place through a window from which  he could step to a low shed from which he could drop to the street.  the facts that he knew of this way of escape and that none of the  people of the neighborhood knows who he was strengthens the belief  that he is a man who secretly studied the ground for some time  before attempting to commit the crime.the low women of the neighborhood believe the ""ripper"" is among  them and they are terrorized.deputy coroner jenkins had the body of the murdered woman  photographed this morning. he was to have made an autopsy when the  photographer had completed his work.a mysterious fire occurred in the east river hotel this morning.  the kerosene lamp in the housekeeper's room on the second floor  fell over and set fire to the carpet. the flames were extinguished  before any damage was done. it is not known how the lamp was  overturned. it would be possible for someone to climb to the top of  the sheds and reach the lamp with a walking cane.mounted patrolman frank of the tenth precinct yesterday afternoon  discovered two tramps, one of whom bore a striking resemblance to  the man described as the new york ""jack the ripper"". the fellows  were arrested for lounging and taken to the sixth avenue station.  there they were held until this morning when justice walsh sent  them to jail as vagrants.the prisoner, whose resemblance to the new york murderer was most  striking, gave his name as john foley and said he lived in newark,  n.j. his companion claimed to be frank mcgovern of the same place.a description of the man was sent to new york police headquarters  and this morning inspector byrnes came to brooklyn and paid his  respects to superintendent campbell. from the description given the  inspector by the superintendent the former decided that foley was  not the man he wanted.in his talk with the chief the new york official said that his  great difficulty so far was found in the fact that all the people  who could give him any information were so drunk as to be useless.  when they become sober the inspector hopes to learn something of  value in his hunt for the murderer. the inspector said further that  he thought the man was not in brooklyn. nevertheless, a description  has been sent to all the stations and the whole brooklyn police  department is on the lookout for the criminal. a policeman brought a pair of trousers, on which there were blood  spots, to the fourth precinct station house this morning. they are  believed to belong to george francois. the police refuse to speak of  this clue.at 2 o'clock deputy coroner jenkins had proceeded far enough with  the autopsy to state that he believed the mutilation of the body  had been begun before life was extinct. he found also that a part  of the intestine had been carried away.brooklyn got whiff of the ""jack the ripper"" excitement this morning  and a man was detained for two hours at the second precinct station  house on the suspicion that he might be the murderer of the water  street, new york woman.   the arrest was made by detective sergeant carney of the second  precinct. he was starting for his breakfast about 7 o'clock when he  saw, lounging on the corner of fulton and hicks streets, a man  answering the general printed description of the new york murderer.  he was about five feet eight inches high, about 30 years old, had  the prominent light mustache which is the most certain feature of  the murderer's description, he wore a similar shabby and battered  derby hat and dark and soiled clothes, and, last of all  circumstances, he was just beginning to recover from a drunk (sic).  as sergeant carney noted these confirmatory details his heart  jumped at the chance that he had got the real ""jack the ripper"" and  his hand was quickly on the lounger's collar. the prisoner didn't  object. he seemed to be used to that sort of thing and he went  across fulton street to the station house readily enough. sergeant  mccarthy was at the desk and sergeant craney communicated his  suspicions. sergeant mccarthy put the prisoner through the usual  catechism with some care. the man said that his name was frederick  straube, age 26 years, nationality german and trade butcher. he  said he was out of work and had been sleeping in the cheap lodging  houses, for the last two nights in the people's hotel, at fulton  and hicks streets. sergeant mccarthy explained to the man why he  had been brought in and the prisoner's face at once brightened. he  said he hadn't been near water street and he knew he should have no  trouble in establishing his whereabouts. he made no objection to  waiting until the new york police could be notified, and sat down  and smoked a pipe in an inner room as though he found the  atmosphere of a station house preferable to that of a saloon. the  new york headquarters was notified, and at 9 o'clock detective  sergeant mcnaughton of inspector byrnes' staff reached the station  house with mary billiter (sic). mary billiter opened the door of  the east river hotel on thursday night for the murdered woman, took  the name of the man who was with her and saw the couple as they  went upstairs. she is the only person who has seen the murderer and  her identification may be very important. as soon as she saw strube  (sic) she said he was not so heavy as the murderer, and not quite  so tall. she was positive that they had the wrong man and strube  was discharged. the register of the people's hotel shows that  strube slept there wednesday, thursday and friday nights. twice the  name was written strube and once strauver by the book keeper, but  every time he had room 15 and paid 25 cents for it. the book  keeper's description of his lodger fits strube perfectly, and there  is no chance that the police have let the murderer slip through  their fingers."

byrnes made a statement last night in which he says he believes the old woman known as shakespeare, who was murdered and mutilated thursday night in the east river hotel, was the victim of a man known as frenchy. the man's cousin, george francois, is a prisoner and is held as a witness. the police say the man who did the deed is still at large. the cousin is also known as frenchy. a mysterious prisoner was brought to police headquarters yesterday afternoon. there are reasons to suppose that this man is the one who killed the old woman. it was after this man was brought to police headquarters that inspector byrnes made the statement. it was typewritten and was read by acting inspector mclaughlin at the oak street station house and in the presence of inspector byrnes. it is incomplete, but neither inspector byrnes nor captain mclaughlin would any answer any of a number of questions put by reporters to cover the deficiencies.the statement sets forth that mary miniton, the housekeeper at the east river hotel, admits that she had known the murdered woman for a number of years. she was known to her both as shakespeare and as jeff davis. frenchy, the man under arrest, admits that on the night previous to the murder, he occupied a room with shakespeare in the east river hotel and that he was in the hotel, but not in the room with the woman the night she was murdered. the man suspected of having committed the murder is also known as frenchy, and is believed to be this man's cousin because the several women held as witnesses say the two men spoke to each other as cousins. the frenchy who is held as a witness refuses to give any information regarding the missing man who is known to be a native of assyria. he speaks an arabic french dialect. he was arrested january 24 last for biting mary lopez, one of the women now held as a witness. he was her companion in the east river hotel the night he bit the woman. all the women held as witnesses knew him and could identify him. he has been known to the inmates of low dives in the fourth ward for several months.    this is all the police would say about the murderer. they have looked up the history of the wretched old woman who was so shockingly murdered. they say of her that she first appeared in new york about fifteen years ago. she was then a fine looking woman, of middle age, very intelligent and quite refined, though addicted to drink. because of her intelligence she came to be known as shakespeare. why she was also dubbed jeff davis no one seems to know. she became very popular among those with whom she associated because of her liberality and for her superior intelligence. she had plenty of money, and when under the influence of liquor she would spend it freely or would give it away. she rapidly sank, and soon became as low as the lowest of the women in water street, although she would frequently disappear and when she returned would seem to have suspended her drinking and other low habits while absent. she returned periodically to her companions in the low water street dives.detective crowley, the statement continued, discovered a woman who knew shakespeare well and who informed the detective that her name was caroline montgomery and that in early life she had become the wife of captain james brown, who sailed a ship from salem, mass., where they lived. captain brown died and left her a fortune. she came to new york shortly after her husband's death and settled in a respectable part of the fourth ward. she had then become a victim of liquor and when under its influence she drifted to the low dives a few blocks away. the women of these places made her very welcome because of her money and she soon spent most of her time with them. she has often been arrested and sent to blackwell's island. when she disappeared from her chums she was an inmate of an old women's home, where her board was paid by a relative named lawson, who is a resident of salem. she was last discharged from the blackwell's island prison a few days ago. her two daughters, ellen and annie, still live in salem.the above is the statement given by the police. when questions were asked about the previous history of frenchy it was said that there was nothing more to say than what had been said.every dive in the fourth ward has been visited by detectives, and when the eagle reporter went to those places to get information about the man who is suspected, the dive keepers said they had never heard of him, although they had told the reporter before that they knew him well.the mysterious prisoner at police headquarters was brought in by captain reilly and detective britt of the nineteenth precinct and detective sergeant hanley of the central office. his hands were tied behind him and he was closely guarded by the three officers. he reached headquarters on mulberry street at 3.50 p.m. later he was taken to the oak street station house. he answered the description given by mary miniter of the man who occupied the room with mrs. brown the night she was murdered. his clothing was the same as that given by mary, with the exception of the trousers, which were different from those worn by the man thursday night.it was stated in yesterday's eagle that a policeman brought a pair of trousers that were stained with blood to the fourth precinct police station yesterday morning, and that he spoke of having got them at a bowery lodging house. the police refused to speak of these trousers. the fact that the mysterious prisoner answered the description of the wanted man in all particulars except as to the trousers, would indicate that after having killed the woman the murderer went to a bowery lodging house, and finding that some of his victim's blood was on his trousers, he secured another pair, leaving the blood stained pair behind him. when inspector byrnes was asked about this he replied, ""oh, he is a small thief we have wanted for a long time. i assure you he is a bum."" but he would not say who the small thief was or why a police captain and two detectives guarded him so closely and had his hands pinioned.deputy coroner jenkens who made the autopsy on the body of the murdered woman, was seen by a reporter of the eagle after he had finished his scientific examination. he said, ""i do not claim, as has been reported, that the slashing must have been done by a left handed man, or that i am sure that she was cut before she was dead. that she was strangled there is no doubt, but whether she was cut before she died from strangulation or immediately after death no one can tell. it is evident that great force was used in the clutch at her throat. the liquid condition of the blood in the heart would indicate that strangulation and not haemorrhage caused death, and yet the amount of bleeding would indicate that she was not quite dead or at least that the body was still warm when she was cut. i found one long incision from the top of the right hip bone descending obliquely across the abdomen to the pubes. the intestines protruded from this cut. it appears that after the cut was made the body was turned over and the cut was continued from the pubes upward and backward beyond the base of the backbone. there are also two long scratches in front and a perfect cross scratched in the skin at the back of the thigh.""""was the cutting such as would have been done by a surgeon as the cutting done by jack the ripper of london, is said to be?"" asked the reporter. ""if it was done by a surgeon he was a butcher. it was horrible hacking.""""would you suppose this murder was committed by the london jack the ripper?""""i am not advancing theories. i cannot say.""water and cherry streets have not witnessed so quiet a saturday night as last night was in many years. the fourth ward was overrun with detectives and the fallen women seemed to be more afraid of them than they did of jack the ripper. the dives were all open, as usual, but the women kept indoors. the east river hotel was doing a big business and the low patrons of the house indulged in coarse jokes about the awful tragedy that was enacted there two nights before.inspector byrnes seemed more at ease after captain reilly's prisoner had been brought in. his detectives were still busy rushing about the fourth ward, but he returned to his normal condition of self confidence. the general opinion of those about police headquarters were that he had his man, but wanted to fasten the crime upon him without a doubt before he would speak of his catch.captain o'connor of the oak street station strengthened the belief that the murderer, or at least the man suspected, had been arrested by announcing to the reporters shortly before midnight that they might go home, because he said: ""i assure you that no information will be given out before tomorrow afternoon."" steve brody seems desirous of getting all the cheap notoriety he can out of this case. he announced yesterday that he could tell who the murdered woman was, and he had a statement printed in a new york paper about her life, which proved to be untrue. then he told reporters that his wife had found parts of the intestines in the street, near the scene of the murder, and that he had sent them to the police of the oak street station. the police denied that they had received anything from brody, but deputy coroner jenkins admitted that the police had sent him a package and he examined the contents, which proved to be parts of the organs of a cat."

byrnes denied yesterday that he had stated on  saturday night that frenchy no 2 was suspected of being the man who  murdered carrie brown in the east river hotel last thursday night  he busied himself with what appeared to be a new clew. that his  statement about frenchy no 2 being suspected of the crime was as  was published in the eagle last sunday and in all other papers more  than thirty newspaper reporters to whom it was read at different  times during saturday night agree. inspector byrnes said today that  his statement of saturday night had been so distorted that he would  say nothing more for publication at present. he had endeavored to  satisfy the public clamor for information relative to the murder of  old ""shakespeare"", he said, but found that he was misrepresented in  all newspapers throughout the world, and therefore he would say  nothing more of what he was doing.in beginning work on his new clew the inspector put all his  available men out to search the fourth ward. they wandered about on  the search for something and at midnight they took mary cody and  kitty lynch from a sailors' resort on cherry street. these two  women were subjected to a long interview and after it was over that  for which the detectives seemed to be searching appeared to have  lost interest. the detectives were called in and those of them who  were not permitted to go home started out as though they had  definite destinations. their wanderings ceased.the result of this work was the arrest of a man early this morning.  he was brought to the oak street station house, and, after he had  been locked in a cell, the police denied that they had such a  prisoner. acting inspector mclaughlin was summoned and he soon  appeared at the station house. at 10 o'clock captain o'connor went  to the east river hotel, where he had a long talk with landlord  jennings. when he returned to the station house he was accompanied  by two central office detectives who had a prisoner, a rough  looking man who was very much under the influence of liquor and who  had a bloated face. it was said that there was blood under the  finger nails of the prisoner. acting inspector mclaughlin went back  to the cells and had a long talk with these two prisoners. then  captain o'connor requested the reporters to leave the station  house, explaining that some police business was to be transacted in  private. the two girls, kitty lynch and mary cody, were sent for,  and jennings was also brought to the station house. these three,  together with the two prisoners, were brought together in the large  sitting room, where acting inspector mclaughlin and several  detectives had a long talk with them all. a dispatch was then sent  to michael whalen, ex superintendent of the barge office, and after  he had visited the station house detective sergeants mulholland and  mccluskey went out separately. they met a few blocks from the  station house and traveled together to the battery, and from there  they went out on the bay toward the italian passenger ship assyria.another search was begun in the low dives of the fourth ward. it  resulted in detective griffin bringing in an old woman, a pal of  the dead victim of the man who may be jack the ripper. she was so  much under the influence of liquor that she could not speak. her  arrest seemed to be the occasion of much pleasure among the police.detectives were again summoned from police headquarters. each of  them was instructed by acting inspector mclaughlin, and they then  strayed off hurriedly to execute the orders received. mary cody and  kitty lynch were permitted to depart. they walked to the east river  hotel and were greeted with a demonstration by street corner  loungers who knew them and who knew that they were arrested last  night in the jack the ripper case. at the hotel they were joined by  jennings and two detectives. they were still there late this  afternoon.it is generally believed now that the police were at sea in  placing suspicion upon frenchy no. 2. he was employed in spechman's  saloon close to the east river hotel a few days ago. mary minitor,  the housekeeper at the east river hotel never saw the man who  accompanied old ""shake speare"" on the night she was murdered until  he appeared at the hotel with her that night. frenchy no. 2 was a  regular visitor at the hotel and she knew him well. among the women  of water street the belief that the murder was committed by jack  the ripper of london, is growing stronger, and each one lives in  constant dread of being his next american victim.the police bore an air of confidence after the consultation with  jennings and the two girls this morning. they seem to have new hope  of clearing up this case into which they have put more effort than  in any other piece of detective work on record."

chat about circumstantial testimony in murder cases, apropos of the luetgert case, brings to mind a remarkable instance of the fallibility of human testimony, as regards the identification of a human body, of more recent date than any instance quoted yesterday. it is part of the history of that remarkable series of atrocious murders committed in the whitechapel district of london, in the autumn of 1888, by a man who is known indefinitely in criminal annals as jack the ripper. his fourth victim was a widow named mary ann chapman. her mutilated body was found at daylight in the yard of a house in hanbury street. on the shutter of the adjoining dwelling there was found scribbled with chalk the following message from the mysterious assassin: ""i have murdered four, and will murder sixteen more before i surrender myself to the police."" sir charles warren, who was in charge of the scotland yard detective force, caused the prophecy to be erased, and was subsequently severely criticized for having done so without securing a photographic reproduction of the murderer's handwriting. this murder was committed on september 8. on the following october 1, between the hours of 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, jack the ripper had left behind him the mutilated bodies of two more of whitechapel's unfortunate women. both crimes were absolutely appalling in the boldness of their execution. one was committed in the yard of a club house while its members were indulging in a weekly discussion. the victim in this case was recognized by her sister, the wife of a tailor, as one eliza watts. the tailor's wife was positive in her identification and called special attention to the mark of an adder's bite on one of the murdered woman's legs. she stated that at the very hour of the murder she had a presentiment that something was wrong. at 12.40 o'clock in the morning, she claimed, both she and her husband felt something fall on the bed they occupied. then she felt three kisses upon her face. she immediately became fearful that evil had befallen her sister, and at once went to the morgue, where her worst fears were realized, and she found her sister's dead body. the identification was made absolutely without reservation, and was supported by the testimony of others. yet at the final session of the coroner's inquest eliza watts walked into the hearing room and openly denounced her sister for having maligned her character and for having dared to suggest that she was dead. the corpse was subsequently identified as that of a notorious woman known as elizabeth stride.this instance of the fallibility of human identification sends our thoughts drifting away from the luetgert case to the historically atrocious crimes of jack the ripper. only the other day a newspaper was published suggesting that a criminal who had been arrested for some fiendish murder in paris was possibly the mysterious assassin of the whitechapel district. among men well informed in criminal affairs it was supposed that the identity of that incarnate fiend was settled some time ago. a well known london physician, dr. howard, gave to the world a guarded statement in which he declared by seeming authority that the mysterious murderer was a demented physician afflicted with wildly uncontrollable erotic mania, and that he had been confined in a private asylum for the insane. at the time of this declaration and commenting upon it, the st. louis globe democrat stated openly that it unsealed the lips of a chicago man who gave a remarkable account of the manner in which the identity of the whitechapel murderer was fixed beyond the shadow of a doubt. the dr. howard referred to was one of a dozen london physicians who sat as a commission in lunacy upon their brother physician, for at last it was definitely proved that the dread jack the ripper was a physician in high standing and enjoying the patronage of the best society in the west end of london. when it was proven that he was the murderer and his identity fully established, all persons having knowledge of the facts were sworn to secrecy. up to the time of dr. howard's disclosure this oath had been rigidly adhered to. robert james lees, who tracked down the ripper, developed in early life extraordinary clairvoyant powers. he was the recognized leader of the christian spiritualists of great britain. while london was shuddering over the third murder mr. lees became convinced one day that another tragedy was about to be enacted. he seemed to see a man and woman enter a narrow court. the clock showed the time to be 40 minutes past 12. the man was drunk. he wore a dark suit and carried a light overcoat. in a dark corner of the court he cut the woman's throat and mutilated her lower limbs with a long knife. then he wiped his knife on the woman's dress, buttoned up his light overcoat to conceal blood stains on his shirt and calmly walked away. mr. lees told his vision to a scotland yard sergeant, who thought he was a lunatic, but noted the main points of his story. the next night a woman was found murdered and mutilated at the hour and place seen by mr. lees. a man carrying a light overcoat had been seen with the woman.one day while riding with his wife in an omnibus mr. lees felt a renewal of the strange sensations which preceded his former clairvoyant condition. the omnibus stopped and a man wearing a light overcoat got in. his face was that of the murderer seen by mr. lees in his vision. to his wife he said, ""this is jack the ripper."" the man alighted in oxford street. mrs. lees continued her journey, but her husband followed the man down park lane. he must have feared danger, for he jumped into a cab and was driven rapidly away. that night mr. lees received premonitions that another murder was about to be committed. the face of the murdered woman was clearly defined, and one ear was severed, while the other hung by a shred. mr. lees hastened to scotland yard and told his story to the head inspector. trembling and pale that officer showed him a postal card bearing the marks of two bloody fingers and reading as follows:""tomorrow night i shall again take my revenge, claiming my ninth victim. to prove that i am really jack the ripper, i will cut off the ears of this ninth victim.""by dark the next day 3,000 constables in plain clothes and 1,500 detectives disguised as workingmen were patrolling the courts and alleys of whitechapel, but jack the ripper penetrated the cordon, slew and mutilated his victim, as foretold by mr. lees and escaped. soon afterward mr. lees and two americans were driving one day when mr. lees suddenly exclaimed: ""the ripper has committed another murder."" it was then eleven minutes to 8. ten minutes after 8 the body of another victim was found in the whitechapel district. mr. lees and his companions hurried to scotland yard. a few minutes later a telegram arrived detailing a fresh murder. with the inspectors and two officers mr. lees and his friends hastened to the scene of the tragedy. mr. lees felt a subtle power connecting himself with the fleeing ripper. all that night the clairvoyant traversed swiftly the streets of london. the inspector and his aids followed close behind. at 4 o'clock in the morning mr. lees stopped before a west end mansion, and, pointing to a light in an upper chamber, exclaimed: ""there is the murderer."" the inspector hesitated to enter, and asked mr. lees to describe the interior of the hall. he did so. at 7 o'clock they entered and found the hall as described. the doctor was dumbfounded. he said he had had intervals when all that happened was a blank to him, and expressed horrors at the murders. after the examination referred to above, the ripper was removed to a private asylum, and by agreement he was reported dead. at the asylum the ripper, who is now a ferocious maniac, is simply known as thomas mason, or no. 124. is that all true? i don't know. things have happened equally as strange. the story is vouched for on high authority.philadelphia times."

even if he were covered with blood, it would be nothing  unusual, for there are slaughter houses near, and i myself have seen a man with a bloody knife held in his mouth run out to  get a pail of beer and then hurry back.""steve raymond is an englishman, too. he is in sing sing for life, and is the only convict serving such a term as that for  forgery. he comes under the amended habitual criminals law. raymond believed the murderer to be a high class, well educated man, very cunning and crazy on that one point. he did not  think the man accosted whitechapel women, but that he sauntered through that locality and let himself be led; then when a  suitable place was reached he would seize his victim after the fashion of the garroter, pull his knife quickly as the woman  became limp and then complete his work.""he carries, i think,"" said raymond, ""some little articles of disguise, perhaps an alpaca coat and gloves, which can be  folded up small and put on very quickly.""all considered that the man comes from the higher class of people, and, being most extraordinary in his character and deeds,  will require most extraordinary means for his capture.at the new jersey state prison the following opinions were obtained:libbie garrabandt, who, when a young woman, poisoned her old husband to accept the love of a younger man, and who has in  consequence spent the best years of her life in prison, did not seem disposed to discuss the whitechapel murders. she said it  made her shudder to hear of such horrible crimes. she believed that no one but a lunatic could be the guilty man.an ex policeman's viewjohn nugent, formerly a new york policeman and who is supposed to have been concerned in the well remembered manhattan bank  robbery, but who is serving a term here for a different offense, knew more of the london murders than any of the other  convicts.this is accounted for by the fact that nugent is one of the clerks of the prison library, and, therefore, has more facility  for learning the news of the outside world.""i doubt very much,"" said he, ""whether it is the one man that is committing all these murders. i don't believe one man could  follow it up for so long and not be discovered. i think there is a band of them, who for some devilish purpose of their own  have pledged themselves to each slay on or two of these women of the street.""either that, or else several men of fiendish souls are acting independently of each other and unknown to each other, one  having taken inspiration from the deed of another.""some of the other convicts expressed themselves with brevity, and a number had nothing to say. here are some of the  expressions:by a man who himself narrowly escaped the gallows: if there is one or a dozen of them they ought to be strung up as soon as  found. they don't need any trial.by a hudson county man doing time for assault: it looks like the kind of murders a woman would commit rather than a man.by a burglar: if they had the same kind of police in newark i wouldn't be in prison now.by a camden barn burner: if it's one man doing all these murders, he's crazy as guiteau was;

detection is almost impossible.""""now, mr. fox, how do you set about disguising a person?""""oh, it is very easy. we change the expression of the face by deepening shadows, alter the shape of the eyebrows by touching  with a trifle of color, put a little hair on with spirit gum, change the fashion of the hair on the head, and sometimes throw  into prominence the bones and muscles of the neck. making up for the street is totally different from making up for the  stage. for daylight use we must employ as little paint as possible. a piece of burnt paper produces a lovely and most  delicate color which we use for deepening shadows, and it is imperceptible to the naked eye of the ordinary observer.""i can produce the appearance of a chin which has not been shaved for three or four days in a very simple manner. the face is  first toned to the required shade; then covered with a thin layer of spirit gum; then a quantity of finely chopped hair is  then dabbed on to the chin and cheeks when the gum is nearly dry. of course the things to be avoided are to leave the gum  shiny and to have the hair dabbed on in patches. practice makes perfect and an adept hand never makes these blunders.minor points of the art""crepe hair may be used for whiskers or beard in an absolutely undetectable manner if carefully put on and trimmed afterward.  but i prefer, instead of using wigs or false hair, to alter the dressing of a man's own hirsute appendages. thus, indeed, by  showing your upper lip. just altering the set of your eyebrows a little and by deepening the shadows on your face and neck a  little you would find your face completely altered. but there is one important thing in effecting a disguise which you must  not forget. it is not alone the head and the face which must be altered. the attire, the dress, must undergo just as complete  a change. a turned down collar, a different suit of clothes, boots and hat, and even the pocket handkerchief needs to be  different from that you usually carry. why, do you know that the very manner of carrying a handkerchief in the pocket has  been sufficient before now to detect a person through a clever disguise?""""how long does it take you to effect one of your startling disguises?""""from ten minutes to half an hour, according to the character to be assumed and the amount of work required. this also  regulates the cost, which is from half a guinea upward. in ten minutes, for half a guinea, i will disguise you so completely  that neither your own mother, your wife nor the editor of your paper would know you. as i have said, i prefer not to use wigs  - of course their use increases the cost - and i always demand a deposit if i loan them. yes, sometimes i get suspicious  characters; then i notify bow street.""during the jack the ripper scare i must have had hundreds of customers. at last it got such a big thing, and i took such an  interest in the affair, i sent across to bow street, and several of my customers were shadowed. one was followed to mentone  and another to new york. they all professed to be amateur detectives, but i fancy some were anything but that, and i even  dare to say that the gentleman himself may have passed through my hands more than once. it is quite a common thing for large  publicans, who own a number of houses, to disguise themselves and visit their various places to watch and see if there is any  shady business going on with their responsible representatives, but i think the majority of my customers are jealous husbands  who think it necessary to keep a sharp eye on their wives."""

(this would explain the ripper's expertise in carving up prostitutes.)that the whitechapel murders ceased because prince eddy was confined to a mental home.that the police, as soon as they learned the royal birth of the killer, concealed his identity and destroyed incriminating evidence.after two years of research into the jack the ripper crimes, i decided that the duke of clarence theory was too far fetched even to metir mention in the book i wrote on the subject.in the 80 odd years that have elapsed since the whitechapel murders, jack the ripper has been ""identified"" countless times, as an unfrocked priest, a sadistic policeman and an escaped gorilla, to name a few of the theoretical killer.sir arthur conan doyle, author of the sherlock holmes stories, was not alone in believing the killer to be a ""jill the ripper,"" a woman, or a man disguised as a woman.the duke of clarence has been singled out for notoriety because the british love to project all sorts of fantasies onto members of the royalty who are known to be soft in the head.that prince eddy, who was sometimes called ""collars and cuffs,"" was not quite bright is beyond doubt. the prince was barely 16 when his tutor, the reverend dalton, reported to the royal parents on eddy's ""weakness of brain, his feebleness and lack of power to grasp almost anything put before him.""despite the fact that he could barely read, the prince was sent to cambridge university, where he was given the honorary degree of doctor of law.as for the ""case"" that the duke of clarence and jack the ripper were the same person, there is no evidence of syphilis affecting eddy's already dim wits. nor would it be an easy matter to persuade british police to conceal the identity of a murderer, no matter how highly born.far from being confined to a mental home after the last of the ripper murders in 1888, prince eddy continued to lead an active life. he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in his father's regiment, the 10th hussars, and was engaged to princess may of teck in december 1891. a month later, he died at sandringham of influenza that had turned into pneumonia.my research into the identity of jack the ripper led me to conclude that the ripper was a barrister named montague john druitt, who came from a well known dorset family.druitt committed suicide by drowning himself in the thames late in november 1888. no murders of the ripper type occurred after that date and the police, after the suicide had been discovered, called off the search for the ripper. from my own inquiries, i have no doubt that druitt's own family suspected him of being the whitechapel murderer."

and therefore i have  not withheld from you the information. by means of the press some further explanation may be  forthcoming from america, if not from here. i have endeavoured to suggest to you the object with which  the crime was committed, and the class of person who committed it. the greatest deterrent from crime is  the conviction that detection and punishment will follow with rapidity and certainty, and it may be  that the impunity with which mary anne smith and anne tabram (sic) were murdered suggested the  possibility of such horrid crimes as those with which you and another jury have recently been  considering. it is therefore a great misfortune that nearly three weeks have elapsed without the chief  actor in this awful tragedy having been discovered. it is not as if there were no clue to the character  of the criminal, or the cause of his crime. his object is clearly divulged. his anatomical knowledge  carries him out of the category of a common criminal, for that knowledge could only have been obtained  by assisting at post mortems, or by frequenting the post mortem room. thus the class in which search  must be made, although a large one, is limited. moreover, it must be a man who was from home, if not  all night, at least during the early hours of 8th september. his hands were undoubtedly bloodstained,  for he did not stop to use the tap in the yard, as the pan of clean water under it shows. if the theory  of lunacy be correct - which i very much doubt - the class is still further limited, while if mrs.  long's memory does not fail, and the assumption be correct that the man who was talking to deceased at  half past five was the culprit, he is even more clearly defined. he was a foreigner of dark complexion,  over 40 years of age, a little taller than deceased, of shabby genteel appearance, with brown  deerstalker  hat on his head and a dark coat on his back. we are confronted with a murder of no  ordinary character, committed not for jealousy, revenge, or robbery, but for a motive less adequate  than the many which still disgrace our civilisation, mar our progress, and blot the pages of our  christianity.the jury immediately returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown."

[copyright, 1888, by james gordon bennett.]london, oct. 5. - the perpetrator of the whitechapel murders is still at large and no clew has been discovered likely to lead to his capture. no further arrest of any one has been made. the excitement in the neighborhood of the murderer's terrible exploits shows no diminution in intensity. it has been ministered to all day by a series of rumors of a particularly sanguinary character, but they have not the slightest truth in them. a cable dispatch about the dodge story in new york of alaska, the malay, excited considerable interest in police circles, and immediately upon the receipt of a copy of the cablegram detectives were sent to make inquiries at the glen line steamship company's, the home for asiatics, and at other places in the east end where it was likely information respecting the malay could be obtained. mr. freeman, manager and superintendent of the asiatic home, said he had been at the home for thirty years and had never known a malay of the name alaska. malays, he said, are mohammedans and do not use european names, but the word ""lascar"" is the mohammedan name for seaman, and dodge might have been misled. recently, a crew of japanese sailors had lodged at the home, and mr. freeman admitted that one of these men was a desperate character, for on one occasion he stabbed three of his comrades who were staying in the home. he was arrested, but when his trial came on the injured men had taken ship and gone away. the queen's music-hall, where dodge says he met alaska, is most luxuriously fitted up, in a style equal to many of the west end music-halls. mr. wood, the manager, says that he had heard nothing of the alleged robbery of the malay, and referred his inquirer to two attendants, alexander nowland and henry pierce, who look after the boxes in which sailors just returned from a voyage usually disport themselves. both men declared that no such robbery could have taken place on the premises without their hearing of it, and as far as they were aware no such thing had happened. axel welin, secretary of the scandinavian sailor's temperance house, west india docks, is extremely popular with foreign sailors. he ransacked his books, but could find no trace either of dodge or the malay. messrs. magregor's son & co., owners of the glen line of steamers trading to singapore, china, etc., stated that the glenartney sailed in april from london for china and returned aug. 14. after taking in a cargo at antwerp she again sailed for china sept. 8 and was last reported sept. 23 at suez. they have no one named alaska on board. the chief cook of the glenartney is a thoroughly respectable chinaman, who has been in the service of the firm for many years, and they have had no malays on the ship. it is the general opinion that the story of the seaman at new york is a yarn.another view.london, oct. 5. - sir charles warren, chief of the metropolitan police force, has decided to employ bloodhounds in his efforts to discover the perpetrator of the whitechapel murder.the police place confidence in the story of george m. dodge, a seaman, who says that in august last he met a malay cook named alaska, with whom he had previously been acquainted on shipboard, in a music hall in london, and that alaska told him he had been robbed of all he had by a woman of the town, and threatened that unless he found the woman and recovered his property he would kill and mutilate every whitechapel woman he met. the police are searching everywhere for the malay.acting on information which has been furnished them the police who are investigating the whitechapel murders have seized and occupied several houses in that section."

(laughter). he had no hesitation in saying, however, that twenty of thirty years ago the people were very much worse than they are now. lord shaftesbury's act had done very much towards improving the habitations of the people and their social condition. what london had now to fear and to dread was the importation of the scum and depraved characters from all parts of this and other countries. russians and poles came into london in very considerable numbers, very largely to escape conscription. dregs of society coming down, as they did, into london and occupying the low lodging-houses, made the centre a very difficult one for the police to deal with. he did not think, however, that there was a lodging-house in the whole district where people would not listen to the sound of the gospel, and he hoped that one of the results of that gathering would be to stir up the hearts of many to visit the people and to teach them the word of god.  mr. owen evans followed in a similar strain, and prayers were also offered. the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman."

""it is desirable that the existing law relating to the custody and companionship of children should be more rigidly enforced. at the same time, some provision is urgently required for the shelter of young children of the casual or tramp class, something between the casual wards of the workhouse and the lodging-house itself - places where only  young people under sixteen would be admitted, where they would be free to enter and as free to depart, and which could be made self-supporting, or nearly so."""

269,index/city_press_19050107.txt,city_press,1905-01-07,"the city press (london)saturday, 7 january 1905a famous city detective.some of his experiences retold.by the retirement, after 25 years' service, of detective-inspector robert sagar, the city of london police force loses one of its ablest detectives. his absence from the hive of activity in the old jewry will be marked, and is already regretted, as mr. sagar has for many years been one of the most popular figures in the detective department at the city police headquarters. the interesting history of his early association with the city of london police has yet to be written, and it could only be written by one man, and that man mr. sagar himself.a lancashire man by birth, he was educated at whalley grammar school, and found himself, as quite a young man, in london, with the aims and aspirations of a medical student. he became attached to st. bartholomew's hospital, and intended prosecuting his studies there with all the vigour which he subsequently displayed in quite another and surprising direction. he took apartments in bartholomew close, in the house of a celebrated city detective named potts, who seems to have been a first edition of sherlock holmes. the mind and imagination of the young medical student became diverted from the study of surgery and medicine to the fascinating problem of criminology, and the varied means which a quick intelligence offered for the detection of crime. hence it was that, while engaged as a student at st. bartholomew's, he became imbued with the instincts of a detective, and so successful was he in that direction that he appeared in a great number of prosecutions of criminals at the city police courts and at the old bailey. young sagar's ability attracted the attention of the late sir james fraser, who was at that time the commissioner of city police, and he called for a special report with respect to the many cases in which the young medical student had been engaged. the report was of so complimentary a character that the commissioner suggested that mr. sagar should join the police force. in the event of his declining to do so, a handsome cheque was ready as payment for his past assistance to the police. mr. sagar thereupon resolved to abandon the dull routine of the medical profession in favour of the more exciting, but less remunerative, life of a detective. the circumstances of his joining the police force were, therefore, peculiar, but that is not the only unusual feature associated with it, as detective-inspector sagar is the only officer of the city of london police who has never donned a uniform.he joined the service in january, 1880, as an ordinary constable, and, as usual, was required to undergo a month's probation. after having completed half that time, he was selected by the late sir james fraser to make an investigation into a particularly intricate case of forgery, in the task of unravelling which several others had tried and failed. mr. sagar at once responded to the call, and proceeded into the country for the purpose of securing his quarry. fortune favoured him, and he was successful in bringing the forger to justice, a sentence of twenty years' penal servitude being the fate of the man who had so long escaped detection. mr. sagar then returned to the city and completed the remainder of the period of probation.in december, 1888, he was promoted to the position of sergeant, there being no vacancy on the detective staff. the title was one of an honorary character, and it was conferred by the commissioner in recognition of special services rendered. in the following june he was appointed detective-sergeant, and in november, 1890, he was promoted to the post of detective-inspector. three years later he was made a first-class inspector. it is a matter of some interest to know that, on the occasion of his joining the police force, he was rejected on medical examination, it being supposed that he was suffering from a varicose vein in one leg. there was no doubt that he had received an injury to one of his legs, and it came about in this wise: before he joined the service he was in the city one day with the late detective james egan. he noticed a robbery from a shop in fore street, and both men started off in pursuit of the thief, who dashed down into chapel street. that thoroughfare was being repaved, and, consequently, they ran along the kerb. unfortunately, one of the workmen had left a pick projecting over the kerb, and young sagar, not seeing the obstacle in time to avoid it, had the misfortune to strike his shin against the iron point, the result being that a portion of the cloth of his trousers was driven into the hole caused by the displaced muscle. nothing daunted, he continued the pursuit, and the thief was ultimately run to earth. the commissioner of police was much struck by the exhibition of such tenacity of purpose in so young a man. ultimately he passed the medical examination.on another occasion mr. sagar stopped two well-known thieves in chiswell street, and their agitation in answer to his questions convinced him that something was wrong; but he said nothing more and left them. soon afterwards a boy passed him wheeling a barrow, on which was a large case. from a point of concealment the detective noticed that there was some connection between the boy and the men, the latter lagging behind in order that the boy and the barrow might come nearer to them in the barbican. procuring assistance, sagar followed on their track, and arrested the trio in the central meat market. soon after they were brought into the police station a message was received from bishopsgate to the effect that a case of boots had been stolen in broad daylight from camomile street. the case, on being opened, was found to contain the stolen property. the foregoing is one of many instances in which mr. sagar displayed his smartness. it was, however, in the detection of forgeries and the running to earth of the forgers that he showed his talents. in the great majority of bank note and other forgeries of recent years, he has taken a leading part. in particular he was instrumental in bringing into the dock at the old bailey a notorious gang of forgers of the most expert and dangerous type - all of them foreigners. it may be remembered that one of them shot himself in his cell at the old bailey after he had been sentenced. two other clever forgers, a portion of the same gang, received their deserts only a few days ago. mr. mcwilliam, who recently retired from the head of the detective department at old jewry, employed detective-inspector sagar in making all the confidential inquiries which needed an exhibition of great tact, caution, and that subtle handling of facts and weighing of evidence which can only be possessed by long experience and careful training. on one occasion the bank of england wanted to transfer three millions in bullion to the bank of france in paris. detective-inspector sagar was at once instructed to take all the necessary precautions for the safe transit of so huge a sum. he accomplished his mission successfully, and ""personally conducted"" the last million to paris.his professional association with the terrible atrocities which were perpetuated some years ago in the east end by the so-styled ""jack-the ripper"" was a very close one. indeed, mr. sagar knows as much about those crimes, which terrified the metropolis, as any detective in london. he was deputed to represent the city police force in conference with the detective heads of the metropolitan force nightly at leman street police station during the period covered by those ghastly murders. much has been said and written - and even more conjectured - upon the subject of the ""jack-the-ripper"" murders. it has been asserted that the murderer fled to the continent, where he perpetrated similar hideous crimes; but that is not the case. the police realised, as also did the public, that the crimes were those of a madman, and suspicion fell upon a man, who, without a doubt, was the murderer. identification being impossible, he could not be charged. he was, however, placed in a lunatic asylum, and the series of atrocities came to an end. there was a peculiar incident in connection with those tragedies which may have been forgotten. the apron belonging to the woman who was murdered in mitre square was thrown under a staircase in a common lodging house in dorset street, and someone - presumably the murderer - had written on the wall above it, ""the jewes are not the people that will be blamed for nothing.""  a police officer engaged in the case, fearing that the writing might lead to an onslaught upon the jews in the neighbourhood, rubbed the writing from the wall, and all record of the implied accusation was lost; but the fact that such an ambiguous message was left is recorded among the archives at the guildhall. detective-inspector sagar, who has made several journeys abroad for the purpose of securing celebrated criminals, is none the worse for his many adventures. with all the great raids that have been made in recent years on gaming houses and so-called clubs in the city, mr. sagar, we may add, has been prominently identified. into his retirement he carries with him the good wishes of all who enjoy his friendship, and have profited by his clever brain."

principle not to give any detail, not to make any comment on things which are  a question of the competence of criminal tribunals, before the proceedings, and not to say more than  the bare minimum, after the proceedings. therefore we are not intending at this point to discuss the  guilt or innocence of the individual named tumblety whom the grand jury in montreal has just acquitted,  and thereto we have only one word to say: if this individual has escaped the penalty of the law,  despite the serious facts proved against him in the inquiry conducted before the police magistrate,  because of the specialised nature of the accusation, it is, it seems to us, the duty of the authorities  to take up again the pursuit of other areas of accusation which may develop from the evidence of the  inquiry.the various remarks that follow are intended to draw the attention of the public and the legislature,  of whatever type, to the importance of legal medicine insofar as it serves to clarify awareness of the  judges and the accused in a multitude of legal processes. there have often been complaints about the  way medico-legal matters are undertaken and conducted in canada. without going over what has been said  at various times, without even putting forward an opinion on the observations of experts in the present  tumblety case, we believe we must use the opportunity to engage magistrates and doctors of this country  to make a serious study of this question in the interests of the individual and of society.it is to provide proof of the need for reform in the method of procedure that we offer the public the  present tumblety case in that it concerns the medico-legal expertise that has been produced in this  matter. tumblety had sold pills and liquids which were supposedly made up of abortive substances, or at  least those which would fall within that category of medicines defined in english criminal law under  the name of ""noxious substances."" the affair promptly and directly revealed one aspect of legal  medicine: for if the medicines were of a completely inoffensive nature tumblety had committed a  deception in aggravated circumstances, and if on the other hand the medicines were of a type to cause  the least danger to health, under the alleged circumstances, then tumblety was guilty of an atrocious  crime.the medicines sold by tumblety have been examined by three experts: mr. birks, a chemist from montreal,  dr. sutherland, a professor from montreal and mr. larue, a toxicology from quebec. the ""medical  chronicle"" in its october issue published the testimony given by the first two experts, and dr. larue  was very willing to provide us, with permission from the authorities, his report which has not been  published elsewhere and of which we start publication today: we do this at the risk of giving our  readers several columns of material which is for the most part barely intelligible to our subscribers,  with the aim of drawing the attention of all to the important subject of the role of legal medicine in  the evading of criminal punishment, and of airing in the press and especially in specialised  publications appropriate discussion to make known the names and knowledge of these men who have devoted  their efforts to these types of study and who are consequently rendering great benefits to society.in the present tumblety case, the opinions of the three experts differ completely from each other and,  moreover, on matters which today can hardly be considered scientific areas. as mr. birks and dr.  sutherland have not, to our knowledge, given a detailed report of the precedures in their laboratory,  but have disclosed only the results of their research, we will report this result as given in the  medical chronicle, then we will publish the report of the third expert, mr. larue.who is wrong? who is right? we are not qualified to pronounce on these issues: but it is obvious that  society and individuals have a great interest to ensure that these very important medico-legal  inquiries should be conducted in such a way as not to condemn without consideration the accused nor to  allow the truly guilty to escape.we are only giving the testimony of  mr. birks and dr. sutherland insofar as it concerns the  composition of tumblety's medicines, quoting from the medical chronicle:mr. birks said: ""after a detailed examination of the contents of this bottle, i found that it contained  black hellebore, or 'hellebonen', and a small quantity of syrup. i have also very carefully examined  three pills and i found that they were composed of cayenne pepper, aloe, savin oil and  cantharides.""dr. sutherland on the question: ""what substances do you supposed were used in the composition of these  pills?"" answered:""mainly aloe and at least two other important ingredients of whose nature i am not sure, perhaps  cayenne pepper and some essential oil... i have examined one pill which was entirely sufficient... i  said that i was certain of the presence of aloe.""the questiones posed to these two experts dealt not only with the composition of the drugs but also  with their abortive qualities. the question posed to mr. larue - and which he answers in the report  which follows - dealt exclusively with the composition of the drugs, considering, no doubt, their  general effects as poisons or substances dangerous to bodily health. report of mr. larue.we, francois alexandre hubert larue, licentiate of medicine, and professor of legal medicine,  toxicology and hygiene at the laval university of quebec, have been commissioned, 3rd october 1857, by  order of the honourable procurator for lower canada, by way of an official letter sent to us by henry  driscoll, knight, queen's counsel, requiring us to prove the ingredients of a certain liquid and  certain pills. on 3rd october, 1857, at 9:30. we received from the hands of the grand constable for the  city of montreal, m. delille:1) a phial, of about two ounces capacity, completely filled with a reddish brown liquid; which phial  was stoppered with cork but not sealed2) a white card box containing ten pills, each of five grains, which box was not sealed.the grand constable and we, having in turn appended our names and the date - 3rd october 1857 - on the  white label on the phial and on the box, these objects were immediately deposited in an iron case which  was then locked and this case placed in a cupboard which contained no similar substances and this  cupboard itself was locked, the keys being kept in our possession.monday, 5th october 1857, having provided ourselves with test tubes, ""horns"" and new receptacles etc.  we locked ourselves in the laboratory of the laval university to which no one had access during the  whole period of our research, the keys remaining at all time in our possession. being unable to foresee  the number of type of reactions which would be needed in the course of our research we had to ensure  sufficient supply both in quality and amount as might be needed.for the present inquiry, we were content to check the purity of  our distilled water and hydrochloric  acid by use of the normal reagents.physical examination of the substances:these substances were presented in the least favourable condition (regarding the state of the pills and  the solution) for this examination: liquid - the liquid, two ounces in quantity, has a reddish brown colour, which takes on a yellowish  appearance when held up to the light from a window. after several hours at rest it deposits a black  substance, extremely tenuous and light, resembling a powder. the quantity of this powder, as near as  can be calculated, would not be more than a quarter of a grain. the small of the liquid is unpleasant,  neither piquant nor acrid - i would not know what other to compare it to. its taste is sugary,  unpleasant and reminded me of the taste of ""ricin"" oil. this taste is not piquant, acrid, bitter nor  corrosive, being neither acid nor alkaline. the taste exhibited no trace of alcohol and a sample of the  liquid, tipped into a watch glass, did not ignite when a lighted match was brought near. one drop,  tipped onto a sheet of white paper, did not stain it. the liquid has a watery appearance, perhaps  slightly viscous; it does not visibly change the colour of sunflowers (? tournesols)pills:- the pills, of five grains, are well made and rounded. the external colour is greenish yellow.  they have an odour of spirit of mint which masks any other smell. one of these pills, when divided with  the nail, was when broken open of a reddish brown colour, showing here and there small red grains. the  paste from which these pills are made is fairly homogeneous. the taste is very bitter, a little sugary,  and above all of an extreme piquancy which burns the tongue. the burning that these pills produce on  the tongue is sufficiently painful that i was obliged to rinse my mouth several times to get rid of it,  and it was only by constantly applying cold water to the tongue that i managed to make it stop. this  burning left only a slight redness on the end of the tongue. this burning and pain are absolutely  consistent with those produced by a few graines of cayenne pepper. two of these graines were extracted  and placed under the microscope with two grains of cayenne pepper, bought from the apothecary, and  presented the same appearance with regard to form and colour. when these two grains were placed on the  tongue they produced this same pain just mentioned.the colour and, above all, the distinctive taste of these grains allow me to conclude the very probable  presence of cayenne pepper in these pills; however i cannot absolutely state this in the present  circumstances.after scraping a portion of one of these pills onto a sheet of white paper, and submitting it to an  examination under the microscope, the substance, instead of exhibiting the reddish brown color it had  shown while the pill was whole, showed a yellow color which stained the paper. there could  be seen  small points of bright white, too small to be separated, and, in addition, those red graines which have  already been discussed; there was no trace of leaves, roots, no insect remains. spread out with a  little water on a glass slide, the substance exhibited the same yellow colour with a light greenish  reflection.another pill, after being scraped and examined under the microscope, did not appear so homogeneous in  its formation. besides the structures observed in  the first pill, others were found in this one, small  light yellow grains, having the appearance of gum. one of them, placed on the tongue, produced a  strongly bitter taste.from the foregoing examination, the results are:1) that in the composition of these pills, there are several substances2) that apart from capsicum (cayenne pepper), whose physical characteristics of colour and taste are  sufficient for me to assume its very probable presence in the pills, the physical and microscopic  examination of these pills produced nothing of note, nothing to justify suspicion as to the presence of  one substance more than another.chemical analysis:on the 7th october, we proceeded to the chemical examination of the liquid; as this liquid was  coloured, we proceed to decolour it. the medium used for this was chlorine. but as the introduction of  this gas could produce other reactions from a range of substances, we watered down a sample of the  liquid to the point where it was colourless and divided this into two parts. the first was treated with  hydrochloric acid. after it was well shaken and left to rest for one hour, no precipitate formed.  therefore there is a complete absence of silver, lead and mercury at the very least.the second part, treated with silver nitrate and left to rest for one hour, showed no reaction.  therefore there is absence of the following acids: hydrionic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, prussic and  oxalic.in a small green glass globe, washed in preparation with hydrochloric acid and distilled water, we  placed roughly a third of the liquid for examination and we subjected it to a stream of chlorine passed  through distilled water. the liquid discoloured and was then agitated, filtered, treated with  hydrochloric acid and subjected for half an hour to a stream of hydrogen sulphide passed through  distilled water. at the end of this period, a slight, white, milky precipitate had formed. in case the  liquid contained oxidised arsenic, it was again subjected to a stream of hydrogen sulphide and heated.  it formed nothing in addition to this milky white precipitate. the milky character of this precipitate  was too charateristic of the presence of sulphur itself to be confused with some precipitate of  sulphur. however the liquid was left at rest for one hour; at the end of this time the precipitate had  not clotted. in any event, the precipitate, because of its colour, could only be confused with sulphur  of arsenic. the liquid was filtered and the precipitate washed with distilled water, then treated on the  filter with distilled water with added ammonia. if this precipitate were due to the presence of  arsenic, the ammonia would have dissolved it and mixed with it in the test tube; and then the addition  of hydrochloric acid, to saturate the ammonia, would have caused the reappearance of the precipitate.  all these steps were carried out with the greatest care but the hydrochoric acid produced no  precipitate.after this experiment i concluded that there was a complete absence of the following substances in the  liquid: arsenic, tin, antimony, gold, platinum, lead, mercury, copper, cadmium and bismuth.the liquid, already filtered, was then supersaturated with ammonia and treated with ammonia  sulphydrate. when shaken, and after waiting some time, there was no formation of precipitate nor any  reaction whatever.from which we can conclude the complete absence of nickel, cobalt, iron, zinc, manganese, aluminium,  chromium, oxalates and phosphates of barium, strontium, lime, magnesium, aluminium.at this point in the research, fortified by the negative result which the physical examination had  provided, and supported by the negative result of the analysis, we did not fear to experiment on  ourselves.not having eaten for three hours, we ingested a large soupspoonful of the liquid - this dose did not  produce the slightest symptom.this last

therefore, an absence of nitric acid.these experiments, therefore, allow us to conclude, as we do, an absence in the liquid of all minerals  and all acids which the examination was deigned to detect.the pills: chemical analysis.we again verified the purity of our reagents.in a porcelain bowl, previously washed with distilled water, we placed four pills, which were crushed  and to which was added pure, concentrated sulphuric acid. the whole mass was heated, being continually  stirred with a glass rod. heated to the point where all vapour had been given off. the carbon deposited  in the bowl, taken up in boiling distilled water, was subjected to the same type of testing as that  used on the liquid: no trace of metals was noted therein.when saturated with ammonia and treated with a moderate quantity of ammonium sulphydrate, a plentiful  black precipitate was formed. the following metals were detected in the precipitate: nickel, cobalt,  iron, zinc, manganese, chromium, aluminium and also phosphates and oxalates. although the quantity of  precipitate was plentiful in relation to the amount of the liquid used, it was too little to allow a  detailed analysis of all substances present. however, the black colouration of the precipitate could  only be due to the presence of iron, cobalt and nickel. but the fact that it dissolved rapidly in  hydrochloric acid served to demonstrate the definite presence of iron.the liquid was filtered, hydrochloric acid added, then heated to boiling point; it was then neutralised  with ammonia, treated with ammonium carbonate and gently heated. a light cloudiness (""louche"") became  visible. left arest for half an hour, this cloudiness increased, very probably due to the presence of  lime which occurs in a large number of organic compounds.control of these two experiments.so that no doubt could  be cast on this report by the accidental introduction of extraneous matter in  the course of the lengthy procedures, the foregoing analysis had to be controlled and so it was  performed again.two and a half pills, divided with a platinum knife, were placed into a porcelain bowl which had been  washed in distilled water. sulphuric acid was added to this matter and again burned. the mixture was  stirred the whole time with a glass rod which was perfectly clean. heated, to the point where vapours  had been given off, the carbonised mass was pulverised in the bowl with an agate pestle and was burned.  treated twice with pure hydrochloric acid, the liquid was divided into two parts. when ammonia was  tipped into the first part, a yellowish precipitate was formed. the addition of ammonia sulphydrate  formed the same black precipitate which displayed the same characteristics as in the first experiment  and demonstrated again the presence of iron.the liquid, when filtered and treated as already discussed, produced this same cloudiness, very probably  due to the presence of lime, of which we have already spoken.when the liquid was heated, filtered, treated with sodium phosphate, a very visible cloudiness  resulted. therefore, magnesium was present. it is normal for pills to be rolled in magnesium carbonate  after they are made.the liquid was filtered, evaporated to dryness and heated to red heat. the residue was dissolved in  distilled water, boiled with a light infusion of barium water and filtered. treated with a light amount  of dilute sulphuric acid, heated to boiling point, filtered, evaporated to dryness: the residue, taken  up in a small quantity of water, produced no precipitate when treated with platinum bichlorate;  therefore, an absence of potassium.testing for organic substances.when the analysis for inorganic substances had been done, it remained to test for and identify organic  substances. in similar circumstances, usually the expert could assess the effects of poison (symptoms  and tissue lesions) and moreover, he could gather from nature various samples of the substance used  which immediately gives him a very strong suspicion about the nature of the substances. in these  circumstances, and when there is available an appropriate amount of the substances, analysis is  possible, although presenting some difficulties; and the result of the chemical analysis, combined with  the physical characteristics and the effects, can give almost complete certainty.here, the pills and the liquid being mixtures in nature, giving no recognisable sign of the substances  used (leaves, roots, insect remains etc.); moreover, the taste, the colour, the smell of these  substances giving no specific character (apart perhaps from the capsicum); and, besides, as there had  been no effects as no one had taken these medicines, it followed that chemical analysis alone would be  able to thrown light on the question and this analysis naturally involved methodical and detilaed  research on all the organic substances. work which is possible on inorganic substances is hardly  available with the present state of science for organic substances. it is quite true that a general  method was proposed by m. stas in 1845, a method that was followed by messrs. orfila, devergie,  chevalier. lassaigne etc. but in most cases only an impure substance was obtainable which was  impossible to characterise physically, even chemically, and one had to be satisfied with various  imperfect reactions. but even assuming this work had been done, even supposing that one had been able to  obtain a subtance in a state of reasonable purity, to allow the use of reagents even in these  favourable circumstances, chemical analysis alone would only have been able to give cause for a slight  suspicion. the reactions which occur in contact with the majority of these organic substances and their  reagents, are far from being characteristic. the colour changes etc., which occur between substances  and their reagents. these same changes, i state, very often happen also between these reagents and  other organic substances. ""if one wanted our whole opinion, ""said m. galtuier, ""we would place more confidence in the physical  characteristics of substances under investigation viz. smell, colour, taste etc. than in chemical  reactions such as are used in the present state of science.""general conclusions:from all these researches, the results are:1) that the physical examination of the liquid gave us no indication of the nature of the substances  that it contains.2) that the physical and microscopic examination of the pills allowed us to assume the very likely  presence of cayenne pepper.3) that chemical analysis demonstrated the total absence of mineral substances in the liquid.4) that chemical analysis of the pills demonstrated the presence of iron in fairly large quantities, of  magnesium and traces of lime.5) that the discovery by chemical analysis of the organic substances contained in the mixtures under  analysis, is impossible in the present circumstances and in the present state of science.signed f.a.h.laruelicenciate of medicine, professor etc.     related pages:  francis tumblety       dissertations: a slouch hatted yank: a few thoughts on the newly found i...        dissertations: a theory on francis tumblety        dissertations: the canterbury encore: the further adventures of dr. tumb...        dissertations: tumblety talks        message boards: francis tumblety        official documents: the littlechild letter        press reports: arkansas gazette -

284,index/croydon_advertiser_18880908.txt,croydon_advertiser,1888-09-08,"croydon advertiserunited kingdomsaturday september 8th 1888whitechapel is earning for itself a most unlovely reputation for the frequency with which murders and deeds of violence are perpetrated in its neighbourhood.  that there is a gang of ruffians going about levying blackmail on unfortunate women there can now be little doubt.  the latest victim is a woman who on monday night was walking with a man, and when they reached a point near to the scene of the murder of the woman nicholls, the man violently seized his companion by the throat and dragged her down a court.  he was immediately joined by a gang of women and bullies, who stripped the unfortunate woman of her necklace, earrings and brooch.  her purse was also taken and she was brutally assaulted.  upon her attempt to shout for aid one of the gang held a large knife across her throat, remarking ""we will serve you as we did the others,"" and no doubt would have carried his threat into effect had the poor woman not ceased to struggle.  when sir charles warren has done with trafalgar-square perhaps he will turn his attention to this dark spot in the metropolis.but there comes a rumour that will be resolved by trafalgar-squarites, and indeed by a great many others, with considerable satisfaction, and it is to the effect that sir charles will shortly retire from scotland yard and he will be appointed to succeed sir hercules robinson as her majesty's high commissioner in south africa.  let's hope it may prove true."
285,index/croydon_advertiser_18880915.txt,croydon_advertiser,1888-09-15,"croydon advertiserunited kingdomsaturday september 15th 1888done to deathby diogenesin the yard of the board of works, which may be approached either from whitechapel-road or eagle-place, stands a mortuary, which during the last few days has been tenanted by the bodies of two unfortunate women, the victims of diabolical treachery and unparalleled ferocity.  the ghastly and mutilated corpse of mary ann nicholls is barely consigned to its last resting-place, and the rough black shell is only just emptied of its grim contents in time to afford accommodation to the desecrated remains of annie chapman.  a quiver of abhorrence vibrates through the land, and we rub our eyes and wonder whether it is not the awakening from some horrible nightmare, or at least exaggerated accounts of the actions of ghouls, ere we can realise that we are in the capital of the country that rules the world.  the papers are absolutely crammed with murders and printed in blood.  whichever way we turn we are greeted with butchery and ghastly sickening details which crowd one upon the other with a regularity that is horrible to contemplate.  a reign of terror has commenced, and so far as the discovery of the perpetrators of those atrocities is concerned we stand paralysed and powerless.  there is not even time for the inquest to be held upon annie chapman ere the thames gives up in the shape of an arm, the indication of another mutilated victim which medical experts declare to be a young and well developed woman.when i heard of the hanbury-street murder i made up my mind there and then to go eastward and see and hear as much as possible in the neighbourhood on the off-chance of arriving at something like a correct conclusion, and i popped into croydon's famous  hostelry, the greyhound, to see the time tables and refresh the inner man. 'twas there i met a gentleman who volunteered to accompany me upon my dismal mission, and i cannot resist mentioning the fact, since it serves to demonstrate how closely comedy is allied to tragedy.  naturally i was only too pleased to have good company, and after troubling the pleasant  barmaid for two drops of special, and receiving host bridle's good wishes and fervent benediction, we found our way to the station, took our tickets, jumped into a carriage, and within half and hour or so got out at london bridge.  i was just about to hail a cab, when my companion suggested it would be as well to have a cup of coffee first.  i didn't want the coffee, but i am always obliging if possible, and acquiesced in his proposal; so we went into the coffee-room at the london bridge hotel and sat down to await the fragrant mocha.  we chatted together for a few minutes, and somehow i thought my friend seemed uneasy.  he questioned me as to the locality, wanted to know how many times i'd been there, and how frequently murders occurred, and whether the police had been strengthened and a thousand other queries of a similar character; and then he took off his watch and chain, emptied his pockets, and called for the manager, into whose faithful keeping he placed them, retaining only a sovereign, and resigned himself with christian fortitude to the perilous venture, first of all demanding i should leave my name and address.we chartered our hansom, and as we glided over the asphalte he reminded me that ""there was nothing like caution.""  i laughed and rejoined most people would spell caution to the wind as his ""cowardice,"" and truth compels me to say that we did not hit it so well after that.  but to cut a long story short, directly he got within sight of the gates opening from eagle-place - and eagle-place is a veritable ""way of death,"" for it forms a cul de sac save and except at those times when the gates are open to receive the ghastly burden of the bier - he became frightfully nervous, and eventually took his departure before he had seen anything of  importance, and i was left, as i have been before, in the company of my own best friend - myself..  it was easy matter to get near the mortuary.  the police were there in great force and kept back the swaying crowds of eager persons who remained spell-bound out of sheer curiosity.  personally, i cannot complain of the treatment i received at the hands of the guardians of the peace, but i think that reporters and journalists generally will admit that scant courtesy was the order of the day, and what information was get-at-able, if not absolutely untrue, was misleading.  many applications from pressmen for admission to the mortuary were absolutely refused, and i have no one to thank for the privilege, if such it was, but myself.  i meant to see the body, or i should not have gone to the trouble of the journey, and i did see it after working exactly four hours and a half as only a man can work who, in spite of obstacles, is determined to gain his end.looking back as i can now, i honestly believe had i known then all i should have known, i should have abstained from the task, and the cold tenants of the dismal dead-house would have been ignorant of one visitor the less.  the faces of the dead are never pleasant to contemplate.  the agonised features of a violated woman haunt you, and the red necklace of a cut throat is an ornament that makes you shudder.  the mortuary, a long, low building, contained on the left hand side of the door three coffins piled one on the other, and two sable shells; the coffins i believe were empty, the shells were occupied.  on the right hand side close to the post mortem table, stands another shell, which reveals on lifting the lid all that is left of the poor unfortunate, cruelly done-to-death ""dark annie.""  it is a gruesome spectacle, and the very atmosphere of the place chills and strikes you to the marrow,  and it is a great feeling of relief that comes to you as you get back to the busy world and leave ""the valley of the shadow"" behind.  those who have looked on that frigid face and pitied it will never forget it.it is an ill wind that blows nobody good.  the local public and beer houses are doing a brisk and merry trade.  the ten bells where walter, the barman, tells the numerous enquirers that he served the dead woman with something at a quarter past five in the morning, and she was found a corpse extended and exposed at six, is crammed, and the people can hardly move; but in the immediate neighbourhood of walter himself they are packed like sardines.talk of types and characters, sorts and conditions.  here you have unlimited opportunity to study humanity.  the lowest and highest, forgetting caste in curiosity rub shoulders, whilst the rich and poor hob-nob over the liquors which are sold, as the announcement proclaims, diluted.there is little to learn beyond the facts already published in the papers.  the police are beaten.  of course they have the usual important clue: let us hope they will make something of it.  if the military magnate, however, were to invite the assistance of the press instead of throwing dust in its eyes the possibilities of success would be materially increased, for the old adage that the pen is mightier than the sword applies to these particular crimes with wonderful and direct force.  i have talked with many people, and the only conclusion i can come to is this:  our police must be maintained and increased in the proportion of five to three; they must remain a civil power in contradistinction to the military tendency at present to alter their purpose and profession; that we should have more plain clothes officers and not so-called detectives, who are as well known as st. paul's or the tower; that the lighting of the streets should be materially improved, and this particular case bloodhounds might, with a fair promise of success, be brought into the field.  the better the lights the lesser the number of extra constables required.  another idea, not a bad one, i think, is to employ our idle soldiers for patrols during the day, and so relieve during the 12 of the 24 hours; and again it might be judicious to give the police detectives a chance, and put the amateurs on the scent by a reasonable reward to cover necessary expenditure.  it is a well-known fact that there are private detectives who can give the manufactured ones a long start and a fearful licking.  surely it is time when present remedies fail, to try others; they cannot prove worse, and may prove better.the d. t. has lately jerked us up and sent some of the nervous ones into fits with the overpowering query, ""is england in danger?""  speaking off-hand, and by the signs of the times, i should say, certainly, if marriage is a failure.  the one topic answers, to my idea, the other one.  apart from this, however, there is no doubt that england is in danger from within as it is from without.  if our swords and bayonets are useless and our ships unseaworthy, surely, in common justice we must class the absolute failure of our constabulary in the direction of the discovery of the agents of crime under the same category.  here is an instance, which i quote from a daily:- ""the conduct of the man who professed to identify piser has caused much indignation, it having kept several experienced officers from prosessing  inquiries in other directions.""  could anything be more scandalous that this - an imposter befooling and keeping several experienced officers from prosecuting inquiries?  why the whole thing is sensless and absurd.  one man, several officers.  the thing is simply disgraceful, and necessitates that these gentlemen who are specially kept not to do it should in future be paid by results.  this does not apply to the regular rank and file who earn 24s a week by directing the traffic and moving on the flower girls and costermongers.i happened to meet a woman on saturday night who knew ""dark annie"" very well indeed, and spoke of her in the highest terms as one who was always ready to share her last penny with a pal. this same woman is acquainted with the notorious bogey, ""leather apron"", and was staying with him the other week at a common lodging-house.  curiously enough, she speaks well of this blackmailer, and says there are hundreds of men in the east and west ends who not only live on the sins of women, but are equally rough and cruel in the treatment of their unfortunate slaves as the now notorious ""leather apron.""  when writing for this paper sometime ago on the subject of common lodging-houses in middle-row, i had something to say respecting the laxity of regulations in these dens of immorality.  the disclosures which are forth-coming in cross-examination of the witnesses in these cases prove beyond a doubt the necessity for legislation on this subject, and the prevention of such places being turned into brothels, where the only question of admittance is a matter of eightpence.  the woman who told me of ""dark annie"" and ""leather apron"" also told me her own history, but it would be out of place and far too long to tack on this time.  the general opinion upon the murder of mary anne nicholls i am unable to write.  it might cause trouble and throw suspicion on those who may be innocent, but the women who walk the streets in whitechapel put it down to others than those who committed the last murder, and their great argument, if you can draw a conclusion, is the absence of any blood in the neighbourhood of the body.  another general idea is that some man is working out a terrible vengeance upon these miserable women through having suffered by their acquaintance and perhaps betrayal.  yet there can be little satisfaction from conjecture unless we are able to punish; such monsters, and at least provide protection, so that it will be impossible that in the streets of our metropolis unfortunate women may be maimed, mangled, and ""done to death."""
286,index/croydon_advertiser_18881006.txt,croydon_advertiser,1888-10-06,"croydon advertiserunited kingdomsaturday october 6 1888in the slumsby diogeneson the eve of the saturday upon which ""dark annie"" was done to death, i made a journey to the shed in which her poor mangled remains found an uncouth resting-place previous to their being laid to rest on mother earth. my visit was a somewhat lengthy one, and i had a fair opportunity to become acquainted with the state of terror into which the neighbourhood was thrown, and several personal experiences to prove beyond a doubt that the facts of the case were in no way exaggerated.  since then we have all read with shivering interest the details which have come to light through the media of the coroner's inquest and police investigations.  after the shock of her horrible death following so closely upon the previous attacks, we are appalled by the indecent exposure and treatment to which her corpse was subjected by a couple of old doddering workhouse inmates, who partly on their on account and partly on account of others, stripped the body and made preparations for the post mortem examination.  it is far from my intention or inclination to stir up muddy water, and yet i cannot pass over the matter without putting on record the detestable fact that a woman should be desecrated, and several important details of evidence lost through the imbecile stupidity of two fossilized old paupers!  not that the men themselves are to blame, but they are the outcome of an ignorant and prejudicial system of bumbledom, which always has been and is a disgrace to any civilized country.  not that it is necessary nor reasonable that in ordinary cases the qualified practitioner should be troubled with minor and unimportant details, but at least these should be entrusted to someone of experience and average intellect.  the very fact that, in a thickly-populated district such as whitechapel, there should be no proper and well-regulated place for the reception of the dead, is in itself, as incomprehensible as it is astounding, and if the frail sister, whose murder is still unavenged, is but the cause of a revolution in this respect, her sacrifice has not been in vain.  she has a right to be regarded as a martyr to conditions morally and socially bad, and we may speak of her as the unconscious pioneer of a movement which is bound to be the result of popular feeling and self-respect.  conjectures innumerable have been advanced, theories have been propounded, and the brain power and cunning of our detective force concentrated, besides the acumen and discernment of the medical profession, with what effect?  absolutely none!  undoubtedly, the primary cause of such lamentable failure may be summed up by the fact that power has been working against power.  it has been individual energy striving to discover the assassin in contra-diction to a collective one, and the truth of the old adage that ""unity is strength"" has once more discovered itself.  clues that have been forthcoming, instead of being attached have been isolated, and the strict injunctions emanating from scotland yard have crippled instead of furthering the capture of a diabolical monster.  the last phase of the whole matter is as sickening as the rest.  the medical world generally is dissatisfied and disbelieving. they say and say very rightly that another opinion shouldhave been taken upon the butchery to demonstrate whether it is or is not the work of  an anatomist, and even then in the event of disagreement between the two surgeons a third, and if need be a fourth, should have been called upon to substantiate the validity of the verdict.  this is too late unless the remains are exhumed, and lest us hope in common decency that such will not be the case.  one blunder more or less in a chapter of bungling is not important.i determined last friday to make another invasion of the locality just to see and hear what i could of the after effects of these mysteries, and as the clock chimed eight i stood at the foot of st. mary's church.  those of you who read ""done to death"" will remember me mentioning a woman with whom i had a conversation upon my last visit, and who then told me that she had not only the personal acquaintance of the erstwhile bogey ""leather apron"", but had also been in the company of ""dark annie"" the day previous to her death.  when i left her on the sunday morning, at something like 4.30 a.m., i suggested that she should obtain every possible information, and in the event of anything out of the way coming to hand she should drop me a line.  it was further settled that if i made a return visit i should write and make an appointment with her, and she agreed to take me to one or two of the worst and most out of the way lodging-houses, where i should at least succeed in obtaining the popular opinion of a similar class of women to those who have been murdered, and who are generally classified on the charge-sheet by the opprobrious epithet of ""unfortunates,"" besides meeting a school of masculine humanity or inhumanity, who would hardly hesitate to cut a man's throat for the price of a bottle of gin.  brutality and fiendish malice may be purchased upon the open market in any part of london quite as easily as beef and bacon, and if the truth of the police courts could be revealed we should find that in many cases the prisoners who take their conviction as a matter of course have already received a consideration to develop their passions, and are but the instruments of unseen hands who pull the strings.  i can prove what i write to the hilt over and over again, and i have not only heard of these things, but i have met the people who are ready at a moment's notice to do any deed of darkness.  the female element is quite as conspicuous as the male.  if these wretches only knew their power and were organised they could paralyse are metropolitan police and run riot at their pleasure.  we talk of the french revolution and whisper of the terrible doings of the communists, but we have, whether we like to acknowledge it or not, a slumbering volcano of republican wickedness of the worst type in merry england ready to burst forth and overwhelm monarchy at a moment's notice.  the great army of the slums only awaits the call of the general, and, once the torrent of starvation breaks the boundary of police supervision, who can foretell where it will stop?my guide and companion on this occasion proved her cuteness and intelligence, and i went in and out, up and down, round and round, making the grand tour, through dark alleys, up narrow passages, now and again just for the moment catching the glimpse of the open thoroughfares, and from the time i met her to the time i left her, with the exception of the main streets, we never met a policeman.  i am not of the murdering type, but i am quite sure if i had been i could have ""polished her off"" with the greatest security; on the other hand had she taken advantage of my helpless condition there would have been a vacancy upon the staff of this paper.we called at three lodging-houses, and with once exception, i found them neither better nor worse than croydon's high street accommodation.  the exception was the second.  when we arrived at the entrance there was neither sign nor token to demonstrate habitation.  it was to all appearances an old dilapidated empty house.  a push, and the door creaked on its hinges, revealing a dark passage into which we made our way, and carefully advanced to the further end, where a gleam of light escaping by the partly opened door and the hum of voices told us some portion was tenanted.  advancing further, we entered an ordinary sized kitchen, scantily furnished, but provided with an excellent fire.  in the centre was a large table, at the further end of which sat five or six women and about half that number of men.  something struck me that all was not right.  it was no feeling of fear nor fright of violence from the inmates, but a queer creeping sensation; everything was so quiet and still.  i had not far to look for the cause.  the near end of the table was covered with a sheet, 'neath which might be distinguished the outline of a dead body.  raising my eyes i found those of the entire company concentrated on the same object.  it proved to be a child, a pale-faced pinched little creature who, totally inadequate in strength to battle with the hardships of the world, had happily found peace and rest in the silent land.  but as the poor mother, who had at the request of my companion had drawn aside the white covering to show us her lost darling, kissed its cold forehead ere she replaced the temporary shroud, and turned away with great tears in her eyes to meet the battle of hunger and trouble without a murmur.  i felt as though my heart would burst with pity, and inclined to go out into the highways and hedges to cry out against the cruelty to and depravation of our poor.  this was a case i knew too well of one who could not help herself.  the poor pleading dumb eyes told her story, and the silent anguish of a lonely woman sent it home and clenched the argument in an indisputable manner.the shadow of death was upon the place and the people.  a better opportunity could hardly have occurred for the preacher to have told the story of a golden lining when the night had passed and the dawn shall come.  the opportunity was lost and lost forever!  after all who could expect any respectable person or priest or levite to know of, or be in such a place and amid such company at any time, let alone the unreasonable hour of night?  it is a special mission requiring brave good men who are neither afraid of hardship, danger, nor contagion, and who are backed with means to help when common sense convinces them of the necessity.  no ordinary namby-pampy tract-distributing black-coated preacher is of the slightest good.  and yet i am sure there are special men, and special women too, with tact and capabilities, who are ready to penetrate the darkness of the slums in the guise of anything but professional parsons or hereditary missionaries did they but know one tithe of the good they might do.  it is absolutely and individual work; directly you commence to organise the effect is spoilt.  these people cannot and will not be approached by rules and regulations.  you must prove as crafty as they are to catch them.  once caught, well that is another matter altogether!  our stay was not a long one.  i questioned one of the men what would be done for the poor creature, and he told me they were in hopes that a friendly lead would be got up for as she had been at one time middling well off.  if such is the case i shall be informed, and hope to be able to tell all about it at a future date, for i certainly intend being there.one of the principal things i learnt on my night's ramble is that the women of the neighbourhood have organised a certain code of rules for their protection.  they seldom go alone, keep within certain streets, and let one another know their whereabouts, and in the event of their going home or leaving the neighbourhood inform each other of the fact.  they have frequent meetings, and chat over anything that may seem unusual and particularly notice the advent of strangers, and, as a last resort, many carry whistles.  on the whole, however, the thing has been a nine days' wonder, and it is only in the out-of-the-way districts such precautions are taken,  but they are wary of strangers, and seldom quit their beats under strange protection without first reporting their absence, as i have just said, to a friend.  it has been suggested by ""the largest circulation"" that the outcome of all these horrors might be a nice commercial speculation - a safe and sure four per cent.  the idea is absurd.  if they did build their model dwellings it would not be for the class of unfortunates, and these will exist as long as there is a demand.  the fortunates - (god save the mark!) - are to blame, and its no use mincing matters.  the truth stares you in the face in the west as well as the east.  again, the real slummers would never accept the accommodation.  you may build canary cages; they are useless for london sparrows or metropolitan gutter snipes.  you must tame them before you cage them or they will die.  build as you will for the working class - they want more sanitary and suitable habitations we know - but if you would reach the real outsiders you must educate, and that can never be successfully accomplished by means of bricks and mortar alone.  it is a work of time and patience.in conclusion, i was speaking  to a friend of mine who took exception to my guide as being anything but a fit and proper person for the companionship of ""diogenes"".  bosh!  i have no need to apologise, and what is more i don't mean to; on the contrary, it is more than possible i may take advantage of the same help again, but lest any reader of this paper should be shocked i will tell you honestly why i took her.  it was the only practical and speedy way of arriving at the truth and exploring an entirely new district that has not been inundated with amateur detectives and aristocratic alummerethe following extract from a letter received from a distinguished detective, dated september 27th, will at once convince you how fruitless it is to attempt to obtain information from them.  i know a good many. and personally they are very good fellows, but it is more than they dare do to introduce a journalist into their runs.  here is the extract:- ""i regret that my connection with the police will not admit of my entering into your proposal.""  and that is how it is that a shabby woman and dilapidated man might have been discovered late on friday night and early on saturday morning wandering about so the ""diogenes"" would be enabled to tell you, gentle reader something about what he found in the slums."

 at  any rate nothing was seen of the couple in the neighbouring public-houses nor in the beer house at the corner of dorset-street.  the pair reached millar-court about midnight, but they were not seen to enter the house.  the street door was closed, but the woman had a latch key, and as she must have been fairly sober, she and her companion would have been able to enter the house and reach the woman's room without making a noise.  a light was seen shining through the window of the room for some time after the couple must have entered it, and one person asserts positively that the woman was heard singing the refrain of a popular song as late  as one o'clock on friday morning.about ten o'clock on friday morning, mr. mccarthy, the landlord of the house, sent a man who works for him with orders to see kelly and obtain from her some money on account of the rent of which she was largely in arrears.  the man went to the window, and on looking into the room saw the body of a woman dead, and mutilated in such a ghastly manner that the observer nearly fainted from horror.  the place seemed like a shambles.  blood was everywhere and pieces of flesh were scattered about the floor, while on the little table in full view of the window, was a hideous heap of flesh and intestines.  mccarthy sent his man for the police, and inspector back, of commercial-street station, and inspector abberline, of the criminal investigation department, stationed at leman-street, arrived within ten minutes.  a strong squad of police was also dispatched from commercial-street station to assist the regular patrol men in maintaining order.  the door was forced open and the police officers entered the room.  the sight, in truth, was enough to un-nerve strong men.  the pieces of flesh which had been dimly seen through the grimy window proved inexpressibly more ghastly at a close view.  large pieces of the thighs had been cut off and thrown about with brutal carelessness.  both breasts of the unhappy victim had been removed, and one of them lay on the table alongside a confused and horrible mass of intestines.  the throat had been cut with such ferocious and appalling thoroughness that the head was almost severed from the trunk.  the body, which was almost naked,  had been ripped up and literally disembowelled.  the chief organs had been entirely removed;  some were thrown upon the floor, and others placed on the table.  it is stated upon authority which should be reliable that the uterus, as in the case of the mitre-square victim, had been removed and taken away by the fiend, but upon this important point the police officers and surgeons refuse in the most emphatic manner to give the slightest information.  it is almost self-evident, however, that had that particular organ not been removed the police would gladly have said so, if only to allay in some slight measure the  panic which has again set in with painful intensity among the poor people in the crime-plagued district.sir charles warren arrived at miller's-court at a quarter to two o'clock on friday afternoon and remained until the completion of the post mortem examination, which lasted two hours.  the surgeon's report, in consequence, will be of an unusually exhaustive character.  sufficient is know, however, to place the crime beyond doubt in the same category as those perpetrated in george-yard, buck's-row, and mire-square.  the greatest excitement prevailed in whitechapel, and several arrests were made.inquest and verdictan  inquest was held at the shoreditch town hall on monday, before dr. macdonald m.p., the coroner for the district on the body of the woman who was so brutally murdered and mutilated in her room in a court off dorset-street, spitalfields, on friday  morning.  a description was given by one witness of a man who entered the house with the deceased at midnight on thursday.  after hearing the medical evidence, the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.supposed clue to the murderon monday night police received information of a most important nature in connection with the whitechapel murder.  a man who knew the deceased made a long and detailed statement, which was not shaken after severe examination, and the police now believe that they are in possession of a clue which will probably enable them to track the murderer.  immediately after the statement had been taken down it was farwarded to the headquarters of h division, and an investigation was at once commenced."
